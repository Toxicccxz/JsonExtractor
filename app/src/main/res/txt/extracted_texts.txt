I should help her work out again.
I need to take her to her art classes again, on Friday at 19:00.
Let's meet up with her in Hentai Impact again.
I promised to model for her again.
He's so kind...and handsome.
I've got some spare time.
If you like, I can model for you.
That would be great!
I'll go get everything ready.
Okay, I'll be right there.
A bit later...
*Knock*
*Muffled* Come in!
(You enter her room.)
Ready?
Yes...
All right, let's get started then!
(You take off your robe.)
(At first, she averts her eyes again...)
(But then...)
(...she takes her top off.)
(And smiles shyly at you.)
I guess uhm...
I could take this off too...
(Wait, what?!)
(She takes off her bra and drops it to the floor.)
(Mmm, it seems our little chat online had an effect...)
(You can't help but stare at her.)
(She has such a beautiful, curvy body.)
(Without even realizing it, you open your mouth...)
Oh, wow.
*Giggles*
Uhm...shall we get started?
Oh! Yeah...of course.
Do you want me in the same pose as last time?
Yes, please.
(You get on the bed...)
(And patiently wait for her to begin painting.)
(She turns to you...)
(And this time...)
(She seems a bit less shy about looking at your exposed dick.)
(In that case...)
(I'll just enjoy the view as well.)
(Her eyes linger for a while...)
(Until she suddenly seems to realize that she is staring...)
*Gasp*
Uhm...
R-Right.
Half an hour later...
*Mumbles* Hmm...maybe a smaller brush?
(She gets up and opens the closet...)
(And starts looking for her paint brush.)
(You gotta be kidding me...)
(She seems to have completely forgotten that you are sitting right behind her...)
*Mumbles* Now...where did I leave it?
(Come on...)
(You can't expect me not to look at <b>that</b>!)
(Holy crap!)
(That is so hot!)
(Fuck!)
(I'm getting turned on!)
(And she's probably not even doing it on purpose...)
(She's going to think I'm some kind of pervert!)
(I need to think of something non-sexual before she-)
Found it!
(Oh, crap!)
*Gasp*
(She just stares at your boner without saying a word...)
Shit! I'm sorry, Annabelle!
I...didn't mean for that to happen.
...
(She doesn't respond.)
(Fuck! What should I do?)
Uhm...maybe it's better if we continue this some other-
N-No!
*Softly* I-I mean...
*Softly* It's...fine.
(She sits back down...)
(Glances at your boner one more time...)
(And then continues painting as if nothing happened.)
(Well, this feels a bit...awkward...)
(But I guess it would make things even more awkward if I leave now...)
(Besides, I'm sure my....situation...will rectify itself soon enough.)
Later...
*Mumbles* There...
Hmm...
Uhm, Annabelle?
Huh?
I'm getting a little stiff.
(As her eyes dart down, you immediately regret your choice of words.)
I-I mean...I've been in this position for a while now...
O-Oh! Sorry!
Don't worry about it.
But would you mind if we finish this some other time?
Yeah...of course!
Cool. I'll see you later then?
Okay, see you later.
Oh! And thanks for helping me out again.
My pleasure!
A bit later...
(Right. That went...reasonably well.)
(All things considered...)
(What should I-)
*Bzzzt*
(Fuck! Were Annabelle and I being watched?!)
You are beginning to annoy me.
Right back at you.
Oh? It seems you are not taking this seriously anymore.
And frankly, I am growing bored.
So let's just end our little game right here and now.
Good luck finding a new job.
(Shit!)
No! Wait!
I'm sorry! Okay?
Just tell me what you want me to do.
It's too late for that.
You've had plenty of opportunities to entertain me.
But you failed miserably.
This game is over.
(Your heart starts pounding in your chest.)
(Am I really going to lose my job?!)
(After all that stuff I did?)
(Fuck! There has to be something I can do?!)
Look, I did everything you asked of me!
So if that wasn't to your liking...
You should have given me better instructions!
(...)
(No response.)
(You feel your heart beating faster and faster.)
(So, this is it?!)
(Seriously?!)
(One thing's for sure...)
(I'm going to find out who this piece of shit is and-)
One.
Last.
Chance.
(You sigh in relief.)
For your next modeling session...
You will get just as "excited" again.
(So they were watching...)
Fine.
And this time, you will ask her to help you with...your little problem.
(What the fuck?!)
And before you answer..
Know that my patience has run out.
If you so much as complain, object or fail to entertain me this time...
Game over.
(You feel trapped.)
(How the fuck am I supposed to do that?!)
(Just ask her...what, exactly?)
("Can you give me a hand with my erection?!")
(...)
(Would she?)
(...)
(She didn't seem upset when I got hard in front of her...)
(Maybe I can talk to her online first?)
(See how she reacts?)
(Besides, I only have to ask her...)
(They didn't mention anything about her actually having to do...it.)
(Then again, that's probably not what they meant by "entertaining".)
Well?
(Fuck it!)
(At this point, I've got nothing to lose...)
I'll do it.
Good boy.
(You put away your phone.)
(I've clearly gotten way too complacent about this whole thing.)
(I should have put an end to this long ago.)
(Somehow...)
(But after all this time, I'm still no closer to finding out who this blackmailer is.)
(And things are getting more serious now...)
(First Olivia, now Annabelle...)
(Crap! Olivia...)
(I completely forgot about her!)
(Although, that's not going to be very difficult to pull off...)
(That girl is already all over me!)
*Sigh*
(What a mess...)
(This has escalated way beyond "just an innocent game"...)
(It's time for me to step it up.)
(Maybe I can use the hidden corridor to find out more?)
(If I start spying on the girls more actively, I might find out something...)
(It's time to use the blackmailer's own methods against them.)
(In the mean-time, I have no choice but to play along...)
(I shouldn't distract her.)
(Maybe she needs me to model for her again in the future...)
(But right now, this is as far as I can go.)
(After your warm-up, you work on her shoulders.)
All right, try to lower the weight gently.
Here, I'll help you.
Okay.
That's it.
Now try to push up as fast as you can.
And remember to breathe out as you exert force.
Right.
*Exhales*
Perfect, that's one...
*Inhales*
*Exhales*
Two...
*Inhales*
*Exhales*
Three...
(Next, you move to the leg press.)
Remember, exhale when you press.
Okay.
Let's try ten reps.
*Exhales*
One...
*Exhales*
Two...
*Exhales*
Three...
*Exhales*
Make sure to tighten your core when you press.
*Gasp* Oh...r-right.
(You notice she's blushing...)
(...and realize your hand is dangerously close to her exposed boobs.)
(You casually continue...)
And like before, let the weight come down a bit slower.
O-Okay.
(She clearly doesn't know how to react to you touching her...)
(...but she doesn't seem to mind it either.)
(You smile to yourself as you remove your hand.)
Four...
*Exhales*
Five...
*Exhales*
Six...
*Exhales*
Seven...
*Exhales*
After your workout...
Well done, Annabelle!
(She smiles proudly.)
Thanks, [NAME_1]!
So uhm...see you later?
You bet!
(She leaves the basement, still smiling to herself.)
(It's really good to see her slowly coming out of her shell.)
(She's still a bit shy, but she's definitely more at ease with me now.)
(Right. So, what's next?)
(As soon as you log in...)
(Incoming message: Bellatrix.)
Meet me at the Pixie?
On my way!
(Let's go meet her.)
A few minutes later...
Hey, [NAME_1]!
Hey, Trixie!
How have you been?
Pretty good! What about you?
Me too. Lots of exciting things happening lately...
Ooh...anything new with Bella?
(Haha! As if you don't know.)
Oh, you bet!
I actually did some nude modeling for her art class assignment.
Wow! That sounds...intimate.
It was. And to be honest I was really nervous.
I thought she would be nude as well, but it turns out that's not how it usually works...
No, haha! It's not.
(I'll just play dumb.)
Well, I didn't know that!
She did take her top off to make me feel a bit more comfortable...
But she kept her bra on.
I guess she just doesn't feel comfortable enough around me to be topless...
...
Maybe she's just a bit insecure?
No, that can't be it.
Trust me, if you would have seen her body...
You'd know she has absolutely nothing to be insecure about.
...
(If that didn't boost her confidence, nothing will.)
(Now, let's leave her with that thought...)
Anyway, I better get going...
But I'll let you know how the next painting session goes!
Oh, okay! Cool, I'll look forward to it.
See you later, [NAME_1]!
Bye, Trixie!
(You return to the world map.)
(And log off.)
(Right.)
(What's next?)
You're really good, you know?
Thanks...
*Softly* I just hope my art teacher thinks so too...
Well, only one way to find out...
(She looks outside.)
R-Right...
Good luck, Annabelle! I'll be rooting for you.
Thanks, [NAME_1]...
A few hours later...
(Oh! There she is!)
(She gets in the car.)
...
(Oh no, she doesn't look very happy...)
What's wrong? Did your teacher not like your painting?
He did. He said it was one of the best he had seen in a long time.
Oh! But that's great isn't it?
It is...
Then what's wrong?!
Uhm, well...for our next assignment...
To show our creativity...
We need to paint the same subject in a different style...
(I don't see the problem...)
(Maybe she's nervous about asking me to model for her again?)
That's not so bad, is it?
We can just do it again, right?
W-We...?
Are you saying...you'll help me again?
Of course!
I'll do whatever it takes to help you pass!
Really?! That's so sweet of you...
Thank you so much, [NAME_1]!
(She looks relieved.)
No problem!
A bit later...
(You arrive at the mansion.)
Let me know when you want me to pose for you again, okay?
Thanks, I will!
Good night, [NAME_1].
Good night.
(She goes inside.)
(This is really important to her.)
(I'm going to do everything I can to help.)
(Besides, it will give me the opportunity to spend more time with her.)
(Anyway, let's go inside.)
I wonder if there's anything useful in my bedroom.
Maybe I should watch some TV with her again.
I'll go get you a beer...
Be right back.
Thanks!
A few minutes later...
(Olivia returns with your beer...)
(And sits down on your lap again.)
(So, this is going to be a regular thing now?)
Tommy? Where are you?
(She takes a sip.)
Tommy? Are you in here?
Ah…
Tommy...?
Here you go-
*Loud scream* Aaaaah
*Gasp*
Whoops...sorry, [NAME_1]!
*Sobbing* Oh..Tommy...
Here...
Let me get that for you.
Oh, no...it's fine. I can-
(W-What the fuck?!)
(She puts your thumb in her mouth...)
*Slurp*
(...and sucks off the beer.)
Uhm...
*Soft moan* Mmm...
Olivia?
(As if suddenly realizing what she is doing, she lets go of your hand.)
Oh! Sorry...
I...got a little carried away.
It's...fine.
Let's just...watch the movie, okay?
Okay...
Later...
That was...
Fun.
Have a good night!
Thanks. You too.
*Sigh*
(She just never gives up, does she?)
(...)
(But watching her suck on my thumb like that...)
(I can't deny that turned me on.)
(One of these days this is going to get out of hand...)
(And I'm not so sure anymore if I would even mind...)
Uhm...you do have swimming trunks, don't you?
Oh...actually, I don't...
Well, you better go buy some then!
Right, sorry....
In the evening, she likes to take selfies in her room.
I guess it's time for another boxing lesson.
I guess it's time for another boxing lesson.
I should check if she really does her chores.
Let's have a little fun with him...
Need a hand?
Oh! Hey, [NAME_1].
Actually...yes, I could use some help.
I'm trying to take a new profile picture...
But so far, I can't seem to get it right.
Do you mind?
Sure, no problem.
(You take her phone.)
Awesome, thanks!
All right, why don't we start with some pictures of you sitting down?
Sure!
How's this?
That's a great pose!
*Click*
Now try leaning back in your chair.
Like this?
Perfect!
*Click*
Let's try one standing up.
Sure!
Maybe over here?
Oh yeah, that definitely works!
*Click*
Try raising your right hand to your face.
You mean like this?
Yes, exactly!
*Click*
Now, let's do one more with you sitting on the bed.
Sure!
How about this?
Great! Hold that pose!
*Click*
Yeah, that's a good one!
I think that should be enough.
Cool!
These turned out great!
Really?!
Absolutely!
You look beautiful!
*Softly* Beautiful...?
Well, I mean...you really look like a professional model.
Here, see for yourself...
(You hand her phone back to her.)
Oh, wow!
These are great!
Told you.
Thanks, [NAME_1]!
You're good at this!
My pleasure.
If you ever need me to take some more, just let me know.
I might hold you to that...
Sure thing.
Anyway, enjoy your evening.
I'll talk to you later.
Yeah, later!
(Victoria is working the heavy bag.)
(She notices you and stops.)
Hey, [NAME_1]!
What do you think of my new outfit?
(What the hell?!)
(Why did she change into something so...skimpy?)
(She's watching you carefully, waiting for your reaction...)
(What is she up to this time?)
(I mean...)
(I can't deny it looks great on her.)
(But it’s going to be hard not to get…distracted…if she’s wearing that.)
Well, it's a bit...revealing, isn't it?
Oh...you think so? 
I just picked this because it feels so comfortable.
(Uh-huh, of course you did.)
I mean, I probably wouldn't wear this in public...
...but I figured it's just you and me here.
And you're my [REL_B1]...
So, it’s not like you’ll get turned on or anything...
(She gives you an innocent look.)
...right?
(Oh, she just loves backing me into a corner, doesn’t she?)
(You keep all emotion out of your voice).
 No. Of course not.
Are you sure?
Because if my outfit makes you uncomfortable…
…I can go change into something else.
(Oh, I see what she's doing…)
(This is just another one of her little games.)
(Fine. I'll call your bluff.)
Oh, there’s no need for that.
You can wear whatever feels more comfortable to you...
Like you said…I’m your [REL_B1].
It’s not like I care what you wear.
(Judging by her expression, she did not expect that reaction.)
Right. Of course you don’t.
In that case...
Do you have time for another lesson?
(What should I say?)
Sure, let's do it!
Sorry, not today.
Oh, okay...
I'll go get strapped up.
Awesome!
A bit later...
(As usual, you start with some basic techniques.)
Jab.
*Exhale* Tss.
Jab.
*Exhale* Tss.
Right straight.
*Exhale* Tss.
(You then move on to the heavy bag.)
One-two.
*Exhales* Tss.
*Exhales* Tss.
Good!
Jab.
*Exhales* Tss.
Jab.
*Exhales* Tss.
Three.
*Exhales* Tss.
*Exhales* Tss.
*Pants*
*Exhales* Tss.
That's it!
(Her new outfit shows off her ass even more than before...)
(Mmm...)
(You end with some light sparring.)
*Exhales* Tss.
*Pant*
*Exhales* Tss.
*Pant*
*Exhales* Tss.
*Pant*
*Exhales* Tss.
*Pant*
*Pant* One of these days I'm going to get a clean hit in!
*Pant* Heh, you'll need a lot more practice before that will happen.
*Scoffs* You're just lucky we're not going by MMA rules!
Oh, really?!
You think you could take me in an MMA match?
Well, let's put it this way...once I get the mount position, you're done for!
Uh-huh. If you say so...
Haha! Aren't you cocky?!
Well then, if you are so sure of yourself......
Why don't you take off your gloves and get down on the mat?
Sure, I'll play along.
But let me warn you...
Whatever you're planning...it's not going to work against me.
Oh, yeah? We'll see about that!
(You do as she tells you.)
Good.
Now, then...
(She gets on top of you.)
(Offering you quite the view...)
Really?! That's it?!
And what makes you think I won't just throw you off?
Because I won't let you...
(She leans forward and spreads her weight out.)
(Oh damn...)
(Despite your earlier words...you feel yourself getting aroused.)
Let's see you try to get out of this!
(Crap! I better put an end to this, before I actually get hard.)
(You grab her waist and lift your hips...)
(And easily roll her over.)
*Laughs* Hey, that's not fair!
That's what you get for not controlling my hips...
And now, you lost the advantage.
I told you it wasn't going to work-
You haven't won yet!
(She pulls you closer and wraps her legs around you...)
(...pulling your crotch tightly against hers.)
(Oh, man...that's not going to help...)
Now, I've got you in my guard...
And I'm not letting you-
*Gasp* Huh?
(She glances down.)
(Fuck! Did she notice I'm getting hard?)
(You feel your cheeks flush, but try to act cool...)
Right...that's enough for today.
Oh...that's a shame...
Things were just getting...interesting.
(Yeah...she definitely noticed.)
(I bet she even gave up the mount on purpose...)
(You both get back up.)
Uhm...right. Just keep practicing, Victoria.
And remember to do your chore tomorrow.
Oh, I will...
Thanks for the training, [NAME_1].
It was very...
(Her eyes move down to your, still half-erect, dick.)
Informative.
(Her eyes glint with playful defiance, a silent challenge that makes you feel aroused and uneasy at the same time.)
*Clears throat* You're...welcome.
See you later!
(She winks at you and leaves the basement smiling triumphantly.)
*Sigh*
(That little minx...)
(She's enjoying this way too much.)
(Doesn't she realize she could get me into a lot of trouble if-)
(What am I thinking? Of course she does!)
(She knows all too well that if I cross the line, I'll lose my job.)
(Yet, the more I resist her...the harder she tries.)
(This is all just another game to her...)
(One that, I hate to admit, I quite enjoy playing with her...)
(I've never been one to back down from a challenge.)
(Even though, in this case, I probably should...)
(But as long as it's just some harmless flirting and teasing, it should be fine...)
(...right?)
(Still, it will be better if Madeline doesn't find out about any of this...)
(Otherwise, things might get a little...complicated.)
(As for Victoria, there's only one way I'm going to beat her at her little game...)
(I'm going to have to ignore her flirting and her skimpy outfits...)
(...and pretend I'm not fazed by any of it...at all.)
(Heh, I'm pretty sure that would be a first for her...)
(Although, that's probably a lot easier said than done.)
(But it wouldn't be fun if it was easy, right?)
(Anyway, let's go get cleaned up.)
A bit later...
(All right, what's next?)
After the training...
Well done, Victoria!
Thanks!
I can't wait for our next lesson...
See you later, [NAME_1]...
(Victoria is working the heavy bag.)
(She notices you and stops.)
Hey, [NAME_1]!
Are you up for another lesson?
(What should I say?)
Sure, let's do it!
Sorry, not today.
Oh, okay...
I'll go get strapped up.
Awesome!
A bit later...
(As you walk up to her...)
(...you hear her softly humming to herself.)
(Oh boy...)
(Well, it's not like I can't enjoy the view for a while...)
(Holy crap!)
(Relax, [NAME_1]...you can do this!)
(It's just her butt...)
(Her beautifully shaped...perfectly round-)
(No! Focus!)
*Clears throat*
Oh! Hey, [NAME_1]!
One sec...
I just need to...
Get this last spot.
(Oh, man...)
Almost...
Got it...
There!
(For fuck's sake! She sure knows how to make it...hard...on me.)
(So...hypnotizing...)
(No! Snap out of it!)
(She gets out from under the bed.)
*Sigh* Sorry for making you wait...
Oh, no problem.
So, did you....need...anything?
Actually, yes.
There's something I want to ask you...
Really? And what would that be...
(You put on your most sincere voice.)
I don't really know how to say this...
So I'm, just gonna say it...
Ooh, now you're making me really curious...
So...
When you are done here...
Yes...?
Would you mind doing my desk as well? 
It's getting a bit dusty.
W-What?!
But I-
Thanks, Victoria! You're the best!
...
See you later!
(You give her a playful wink as you leave your room.)
(Heh. I guess we're even now.)
Meanwhile...
*Softly* Well, aren't you just full of surprises, [NAME_1].
*Softly* This is going to be even more fun than I expected...
Victoria
(As you enter your bedroom, you find Victoria in a rather...provocative position.)
(As agreed, she is doing her chore...)
(...wearing her skimpy outfit again.)
(Wow...really?!)
(So much for subtlety, I guess...)
(Although, I can't say I don't appreciate the effort...)
(...)
(But it's time to show her she's not the only one who can play games...)
(I'll just leave her alone for now.)

Victoria
(As you enter her room, you realize it looks a lot different than the last time you saw it.)
Take off your clothes?
Hey, Annabelle.
(She looks so hot in that tiny outfit!)
(Today's a big day for Annabelle...)
(Her painting will be evaluated by her teacher.)
Are you nervous?
Uhm...yeah, a little bit.
I'm sure it will be fine.
I should probably explore the mansion.
Also, it will give you the chance to get to know...the girls.
Yes, honey.
*Whisper* It's not like you asked me for permission!
*Whisper* Continue?! Are you not-
(Olivia looks at you with a mixture of suprise and relief.)
*Whisper* Aren't you being a bit of a hypocrit?
(Victoria is taking selfies...)
(...again.)
(If I want to meet up with her, I should probably check at a different time.)

Annabelle seems to be a very timid girl. But maybe you just need to get to know her a bit better...
gaming
drawing
anime
working out
being the center of attention
Art class (19:30 - 21:30)
She takes her showers in the morning. I have to make sure I'll be in the upstairs bathroom before she gets there.
I need to take her to her art classes on Friday at 19:00.
Maybe I can find out a bit more about her by talking to one of the other girls?
Maybe one of the girls has a spare laptop I could borrow?
I saw her going into the study, carrying an old book.
She works out late in the afternoon.
Maybe I should join the girls for dinner?
Olivia promised me she would leave her laptop in my room.
I should try installing Hentai Impact on the laptop.
Maybe I can find a way to get into her room when Kate is cleaning it?
Maybe a "toilet emergency" would get Kate to leave Annabelle's room.
Do you really want me to spell it out? Use the toilet roll on the toilet!
I need to take her to her art classes again, on Friday at 19:00.
I could spy on her when she takes her morning bath.
I promised Madeline I would help Annabelle with her workout.
I need to wait for Olivia to tell me what she wants in return for the laptop.
Maybe I should focus on Olivia for a bit.
If she doesn't feel like working out, I should cut her some slack.
I should cover for her during dinner.
Maybe I shouldn't lie for her during dinner.
I should spy on her and Madeline at midnight.
If I want to help her work out, I'll need to get a proper outfit first.
I should log in to Hentai Impact when she is online and try to find her.
Let's log in to Hentai Impact when she is online and finish what I was doing.
Let's log in to Hentai Impact when she is online and meet up with her again.
I think I saw her going to the pool in the afternoon.
I should talk to her when she's at the pool in the afternoon.
Maybe I should pay a visit to Sweat in Style at the mall.
Let's meet up with her in Hentai Impact again.
It's time for another workout.
She likes to paint in the back yard in the afternoon.
I hope he doesn't talk to me.
At least he seems to be friendly.
He's actually quite nice.
He makes me feel so much better about myself.
(All right, [NAME_1], you know the drill...)
(Let's take a shower.)
(I guess I'll just jerk off for a bit, since I need to get hard...)
A bit later...
*Sigh*
(Now I'm feeling horny...)
(But I guess that was the point.)
(You hear footsteps approaching.)
(There she is.)
(You put the towel over your head just like you did with Olivia.)
(You hear the door open.)
*Gasp*
(This is so wrong.)
Annabelle?!
What the hell?!
S-Sorry!
T-The door was open! I...I thought-
...
(She runs out of the bathroom and quickly closes the door.)
*Muffled* I...I-
*Muffled* Sorry!
(You hear her leave.)
(Well...mission accomplished, I guess...)
(But I feel like an asshole for doing that to her.)
(I hope she's okay.)
(You put your clothes back on and leave the bathroom.)
(As you walk past Annabelle's bedroom, you hear a sound coming from inside.)
(Huh? Is she...crying?)
(Crap! I didn't think she'd be that upset...)
(You press your ear against the door.)
(Wait! That's not crying...)
(Is she...)
(Moaning?!)
Meanwhile in Annabelle's room...
(So, the shy girl has a naughty side as well...)
(Interesting.)
(Anyway, I better get out of here, before someone sees me.)
(Annabelle is having breakfast.)
Good morning, Annabelle.
(She blushes and avoids making eye contact with you.)
*Softly* Good morning.
So, any big plans for today?
Uhm...not really.
...
...
(She seems uncomfortable talking to you, so you decide to leave her alone.)
Right. Well...enjoy your day.
*Softly* Thanks, you too.
Good morning, [NAME_1].
(I already talked to her.)
(She seems to be focused on her studies.)
(I shouldn't be bothering her right now.)
(Annabelle is staring dreamily into the distance.)
Don’t feel like studying?
(She startles, snapping out of her thoughts.)
Oh! Uhm, no, I was just...thinking.
Oh, my bad. I didn't mean to interrupt you.
(She blushes.)
*Softly* That's okay.
Well, I’ll leave you to it then.
See you later!
Uhm...bye.
(You notice a familiar looking book under Annabelle's arm.)
(Is that...one of the books of sin?)
(You walk up to her.)
*Clears throat*
*Gasp* [NAME_1]!
Hey Annabelle, sorry to bother you...
But I noticed that book you have there.
Book?
Oh!
You mean this one?
Yeah. I was wondering if I could maybe borrow it?
If it's not too much trouble?
Oh, no! Not at all!
I already finished it.
(Finished it?)
(Don't tell me she actually reads this stuff?!)
Uhm...here you go.
Wow! Thank you so much!
(You take the book from her.)
You're welcome.
(Great! I'm one step closer to finding out what that bookcase is hiding.)
(I already talked to her.)
(Annabelle is so focused on her painting that she doesn’t even notice you.)
Wow, Annabelle!
Oh! [NAME_1]!
That looks amazing!
T-Thanks.
...
*Softly* Uhm...
(She clearly isn't comfortable with you watching her paint.)
Right. I'll leave you alone.
Good luck with the painting!
*Softly* Thank you.
Looking good, Annabelle.
Oh! Hey, [NAME_1]!
Thanks!
Oh...by the way...
About that...uhm...thing you promised me the other day...
What thing was that?
You know...to be my...uhm...model?
Oh! Right!
What about it?
Do you think...uhm...
We could do it now?
(What should I say?)
Sure, why not?
Now's not really a good time for me, sorry.
(I haven't been working out much lately...)
(I would probably feel a bit more comfortable if I am in good shape.)
Oh, s-sorry!
Don't worry about it!
I'll let you know when I'm ready.
Okay...thanks.
Really? That's great!
I'll go make preparations...
Can you meet me in my room when you're ready?
Sure, I'll be right there.
A bit later...
*Knock*
*Muffled* Come in!
(The pink lighting isn't on and she has set up her easel in the corner.)
(You also notice her monitors are switched off.)
(Smart. After all, she doesn't want me to find out she plays Hentai Impact.)
Wow! You have a cool room, Annabelle.
Thanks!
And that's some rig you've got there!
I bet it runs any game at the highest settings.
Oh, it does!
It's my pride and joy!
(Let's tease her a bit.)
Yeah, I'll bet.
You know, I play this game, called "Hentai Impact"...
Oh...
Ever heard of it?
Uhm...no, I don't think I have...
(Tsk. Naughty girl.)
Well, maybe you should check it out sometime.
I think you'll like it.
T-Thanks...maybe I will.
Right then, shall we get started?
(You take off your robe.)
(Annabelle is awkwardly trying to avoid looking at your exposed body.)
(Hmm...I wonder if I can use this opportunity to loosen her up a little...)
Uhm...Annabelle?
Yes?
Aren't you going to...you know?
Uhm...?
*Gasp* W-What?!
Well...it'll be a bit awkward if it's just me who's naked, don't you think?
I-I don't...w-what do you mean?
Normally both the artist and the model get naked, don't they?
So no-one feels uncomfortable.
I...uhm...I don't think they do...
Oh, really?
I guess I must have misunderstood then...sorry.
(Oh, well...it was worth a shot.)
I guess I...wouldn't mind taking off my top...
If that makes you feel...more comfortable?
(Oh, wow! I didn't expect that...)
(But it might help boost her confidence some more.)
Yeah, I think it would help.
Okay.
(And just like that...)
(Annabelle removes her top...)
(Revealing her gorgeous body.)
(Oh, wow...)
(She looks so sexy.)
I like your lingerie. Black definitely suits you.
Oh...t-thanks.
So, where do you want me?
On the bed?
Uhm...yes please.
Just make yourself comfortable.
(You do as she tells you.)
Is this pose any good?
Y-Yeah...that's fine.
(It seems she's still trying to avoid looking at you.)
Are you sure?
I have no idea what I'm doing, so I'll need your directions...
Oh...r-right.
(She looks at you tentatively.)
(Her eyes go down for a split second...)
(...but she immediately looks away again.)
(Giving you the perfect opportunity to sneak a peek at her beautiful, big breasts.)
Just relax, Annabelle. It's only a naked body.
Besides, you're not going to be able to paint me if you don't look at me, right?
R-right...
(She looks at you again.)
(Taking in...everything.)
(She still seems a bit uncomfortable...)
(But her eyes linger a bit longer this time.)
(...before focusing her attention on your face again.)
Could you uhm...try to stay in that position?
Sure. No problem.
(And so, Annabelle begins painting you.)
Two hours later...
There.
I think that should be enough.
Cool, I can't wait to see what you painted.
(You walk over to her.)
Wow! That's amazing, Annabelle!
R-Really?! You think so?
Are you kidding me?!
Of course!
I'm genuinely impressed!
Thanks, [NAME_1]!
I'm so happy you like it!
I really appreciate your-
*Gasp*
*Softly* ...help.
Oh! It's my pleasure!
Seeing the end result definitely made it worth the wait!
A bit later...
Thanks again, [NAME_1].
I should be able to finish the painting now.
I'm glad I could help.
I'm sure you'll pass your assignment with this!
Thanks. I hope so.
Well, I'll let you get to it then.
See you later!
Bye.
You go back to your room and change...
(I hope this will help her break out of her shell a bit...)
(Especially seeing how talented she is.)
(Anyway...what's next?)
Oh! Hey, [NAME_1]!
(Annabelle is working out.)
(But her gaze wanders as she just sits on the bench, not actively exercising.)
(As soon as she sees you, she suddenly starts working out.)
*Panting* ...ten!
(She gets up.)
Oh! Hi, [NAME_1]...
(Knowing she is obviously faking it, you suppress a smile.)
Hey, Annabelle.
Working out hard, I see?
(She blushes and averts her eyes.)
Mm-hm.
That's great! Keep it up!
*Softly* T-Thanks.
(She returns to her workout.)
Oh. Hi, [NAME_1].
Hey, would you like to work out together?
*Gasp* W-What, now?!
Yeah, why not?
It looks like you just started, so I might as well join you, right?
Unless...you don't want my help-
N-No! I mean...I do!
Cool. Let me get changed and I'll be back in 5 minutes.
Okay...
A bit later...
Oh. Hi, [NAME_1].
Hey, ready for our workout?
Uhm...
Actually, I'm feeling a bit sore today...
(What should I do?)
(Motivate her.)
(Allow her to slack off.)
Oh...okay.
Just take it easy then...
We can work out together some other time.
Thanks.
Don't worry.
That's all part of the process, Annabelle.
But you have to push through if you want to see the results.
I guess you're right...
Let's do it!
All right then. I'll go get changed.
Okay.
A bit later...
(You start with a quick warm-up...)
That's it!
Let's get those muscles nice and warm.
A good warm-up will help to prevent injuries.
So make sure never to skip it.
Okay!
(You gradually pick up the pace...)
(To get your heart rate up a bit.)
(Then you do some sit-ups with her...)
(To increase her core strength.)
Good!
*Grunts*
Seven...
*Grunts*
Eight...
*Grunts*
Come on, you can do it!
(After that you focus on her back muscles...)
Good.
Remember...
Don't hold your breath!
Exhale when you pull the weight down.
*Exhales*
That's it!
Keep going...
(And finally her chest muscles...)
Come on!
Just a few more!
*Grunts*
That's it!
Don't give up!
I...
*Grunts* Won't!
(She looks up at you...)
(And for a moment, you get lost in her beautiful, big green eyes.)
(Wow...)
(She really is stunning...)
(She's got such a pretty face.)
(And her body...)
(Without thinking, your eyes drift down...)
(And you admire her huge breasts.)
(...)
(Suddenly, you realize you're not only staring at her boobs, but you stopped talking as well...)
(Oh, crap!)
(You feel your cheeks flush and quickly meet her eyes.)
(It looks like she didn't notice you staring...)
(For a brief moment, you see a slight smile on her face.)
(Or did she?)
Okay, just one more...
Perfect!
After your workout...
Great job, Annabelle!
You worked really hard.
(She smiles proudly.)
Thanks...
I uhm...
I really appreciate you helping me out like this...
Don't mention it, it's my pleasure!
Thanks. I should get...freshened up.
Yeah, me too.
See you later!
Bye.
(I already talked to her.)
(If I want to help her with her workout, I'll have to get a proper outfit first.)
(Maybe I should do some shopping?)
(You put on your best nervous act.)
Before we begin...
I uhm...I wanted to give you a little present.
A present?!
For me?
You shouldn't have...
(She feigns surprise quite convincingly.)
(In fact, if you didn't know any better, you would think it was genuine.)
Well, I saw this at the mall and it made me... think of you.
Really?! That's so sweet of you!
(You give her the outfit.)
*Gasp* A-A workout outfit?!
(This time you know for a fact that her suprise is not an act.)
As soon as I saw this, I thought it would be perfect for you.
Uhmm...but isn't a bit...small?
Oh, you think?
(Now it's your turn to feign innocence.)
Is it? I didn't really notice...
Uhm...I don't think it will...fit me.
(Your hopes of seeing her in this outfit are slowly fading away...)
(And you realize you have to step it up a notch.)
You don't like it, do you?
N-No!
I-I mean...I do like it!
It's just...that I-
It's fine. You don't have to explain.
I'm sure I can still return it.
*Gasp* Return it? N-No!
At least let me try it on first!
Really, you don't have to do that, Annabelle.
B-But I want to!
I won't know what it looks like until I try it on, right?
Well, if you are sure you want to...
I mean, I can't deny I would love to see how it looks on you.
Oh...actually, I meant...
(She trails off.)
Uhm, sure...I guess I could show you...
(Yes!)
I'll uhm...be right back.
Great! I'll go get changed as well.
(As she leaves the basement, you are filled with anticipation.)
(Oh man...I can't wait to see her in that outfit...)
Much later...
What's taking her so long?
(I hope she didn't change her mind...)
(Maybe I should go up to her-)
(You hear someone coming down the stairs.)
(Is that her?!)
(She enters the basement, wearing the outfit and blushing furiously.)
(Holy...)
(Fuck!)
Wow...
It's a bit too...revealing...
Isn't it?
What?! No way!
I think it's perfect!
Honestly, Annabelle...you look very hot.
Y-You think I look hot?!
Super hot!
Trust me, most guys would only dream of having a girlfriend as hot as you.
N-No...I don't think that's true.
(In for a penny...)
I know I would.
*Gasp*
*Softly* T-Thanks...
You have an amazing body, Annabelle.
You shouldn't be ashamed to show it.
...
I guess I could keep it on...
It does feel really comfortable...
(Fuck, yeah!)
Thanks for the present, [NAME_1].
That was really sweet of you.
You're very welcome!
I'm just glad you like it.
I do.
Great! Well then, let's work out!
(As usual, you start with a quick warm-up...)
That's it!
Let's get those muscles nice and warm.
You're doing great!
Keep it up!
Okay!
(You glance over to your side and are treated to a beautiful view.)
(Mmm...)
(But I think we can do even better...)
All right, now let's take this to the next level.
Let's get up and lean forward to increase the intensity a bit more.
Okay!
(She does as you tell her...)
(Presenting you with an even better view of her beautiful thick ass.)
(Oh, man...)
(I better be careful I don't get turned on too much...)
Excellent!
That's enough for now.
(After your warm-up, you move on to sit-ups...)
(This time, giving you an amazing view of her big tits.)
(Oh man...I've got to focus!)
*Grunts*
Seven...
*Grunts*
Eight...
*Grunts*
Come on, you can do it!
*Grunts*
One more...
*Grunts*
(And finally, some back exercises...)
That's it!
Beautiful form, Annabelle!
(Beautiful indeed...)
You're doing great!
*Exhales*
Four more!
*Exhales*
Three!
*Exhales*
Two!
*Exhales*
Last one!
*Exhales*
Great job!
After your workout...
Well done, Annabelle!
You're making great progress.
(She smiles proudly.)
It's all thanks to you, [NAME_1]!
Hey, you're the one putting in all the hard work.
But it's safe to say that we make a great team.
*Giggles* Definitely!
Thanks for the workout!
See you later?
Sure thing!
Oh. Hi, [NAME_1].
Hey, ready for our workout?
Uhm...
Actually, I'm feeling a bit sore today...
(What should I do?)
(Motivate her.)
(Allow her to slack off.)
Oh...okay.
Just take it easy then...
We can work out together some other time.
Thanks.
Don't worry.
That's all part of the process, Annabelle.
But you have to push through if you want to see the results.
I guess you're right...
Let's do it!
All right then. I'll go get changed.
Okay.
A bit later...
(You walk up to her.)
Hey, Annabelle.
Hi, [NAME_1]...
(I shamelessly check out her, making no effort whatsoever to hide it.)
(Oh, man...)
(She has such a thick, curvy body.)
(I would love to see her in something a bit more...revealing...)
(But it's a start.)
(And I'll gladly take it.)
(You intentionally let your eyes linger a little while longer, without saying anything.)
(Annabelle, clearly outside of her comfort-zone, is first to break the silence.)
I...uhm...I figured I'd work on my tan a bit.
I see.
Well, whatever you're doing...it's working.
Because you look amazing.
*Gasp*
Uhm...t-thanks.
Well, I'll leave you to it.
Enjoy the sun.
(You smile and wink at her.)
T-Thanks! You too!
I mean...bye.
(Haha! She's so cute.)
(I already talked to her.)
(What should we talk about?)
me
Olivia
you
Victoria
Madeline
John
Rebecca
Kate
At first, the thought of having a [REL_B1] made me a bit...nervous.
But now that I'm getting to know you better, I really like it.
I'm happy to hear that.
And I'm glad I got to know you.
Thanks...me too.
We don't really spend a lot of time together...
But I think she's nice.
M-Me?!
Uhm...
There isn't much to tell you...
Sure there is!
What about your hobbies?
Oh...well, I like drawing...
And painting...
And video games.
Wow!
I think it's so cool when someone is artistic.
Really?!
Of course! It's so impressive!
I can't even draw a decent stick figure...
*Laughs*
And who doesn't love video games?!
Life would be so boring without them.
I know, right?!
Uhm...I don't think she really likes me...
What makes you say that?
Well, she doesn't really talk to me a lot...
Maybe it's because we are so unalike?
She works out a lot and she's very active on social media.
And she's super confident...she loves posting selfies...
And me...I'm just...
A bit more...reserved, I guess?
She's amazing!
I admire her a lot, she's so smart and successful...
And she's teaching us how to be like her.
She's also very supportive of my art!
Of course, she can be a bit strict sometimes...
But that's just for our own benefit.
Honestly...I hardly knew him.
All he ever cared about was his company...
I like her a lot.
I know it's her job, but she always looks after us.
And I think she likes it too.
I don't really know her yet.
She only started working here one day before you came.
But she seems nice.
Uhm..it's getting a bit late...
I should be going.
Okay. See you later.
Bye!
I should be going.
Oh, okay.
Bye, [NAME_1].
(It will probably take me a few hours to get everything set up.)
(Should I do it now?)
(Let's go for it!)
(I don't have time for that right now.)
(All right, let's see if I can if get this to work...)
Some time later...
(Yes! I actually got it to run!)
(Now, let's see what this game is all about...)
Welcome to Hentai Impact!
Click to start.
Enter your name.
(I'll just stick with [NAME_1].)
Choose your gender.
(Male.)
Choose your avatar.
(Hmm, there's a human, an orc and a demon.)
(Oh, apparently you can unlock more avatar choices in their shop.)
(I guess that explains how they make money...)
(I'll go with the...)
(Human.)
(Orc.)
(Demon.)
Get ready, [NAME_1]...
Your arousing adventure begins now!
(Great! Let's go!)
But first, we'll show you a quick tutorial so you can learn the basics.
*Sigh* Of course...
Much later...
(Finally...that took way too long.)
(So, this is the world map?)
(It's a lot bigger than I expected...)
(How am I ever going to find Annabelle?!)
(I have no idea where to go...)
(And there's no point in running around aimlessly.)
(Besides, this took up way too much of my time already.)
(Let's stop for now.)
(I need to find out what Annabelle's character is called.)
(Maybe I can sneak into her room and have a look, when she's not around?)
(I guess it will have to wait.)
(Before I can continue playing, I need to find out what Annabelle's character is called.)
(Maybe I can sneak into her room and have a look, when she's not around?)
(Let's do this.)
A bit later...
(Okay.)
(Right now, I am here.)
(When I checked her computer, Annabelle was in The Pervy Pixie, somewhere in the capital...)
(Which should be here.)
(So, I guess I'll go there and try to find her.)
(Oh, it seems I'll have to pass through the city gates first.)
(Let's start there, then.)
A bit later...
(Incoming message: Bellatrix.)
(Oh! It's Annabelle!)
(Let's see....how does this work?)
Hey, [NAME_1]!
I was just on my way to the Pervie Pixie.
Care to join me?
Sure! I'll be right there.
Cool!
(Wow. That was fast.)
(Was she waiting for me to come online?)
(Anyway, let's go meet her.)
A few minutes later...
There you are!
Hey, Bellatrix!
It's good to see you again.
You too!
So, how's the new job going?
(She doesn't waste any time...)
Pretty good, actually.
I'm slowly starting to settle in.
I'm sure you are...
Living together with all those pretty girls, haha.
(I guess she's still not going to tell me it's her.)
(But I'll play along with her little game.)
Oh, yeah. It’s been great!
I'm starting to get to know the girls a bit better.
Well...two of them, at least.
Oh? Not all three?
Not really...
I haven't been able to get much closer to-
Let's just call her Bella.
Okay...
I told you...your names are a lot alike.
Oh, right...
Is that the girl you were talking about the other day?
The pretty one?
(Haha! Yes, Annabelle...you.)
Yeah.
But she hardly ever comes out of her room.
She doesn’t seem to be interested in spending time with me at all.
Maybe she’s just a little shy?
(Oh, no. You’re not getting out of it that easy.)
Who knows?
(Let’s see if I can draw her out of her shell a bit.)
But at least I’m getting closer to the other two girls.
You are?
Yeah, we've been spending some more time together.
(Let's see if she takes the bait.)
Hanging out at the pool.
The pool?
Oh, yeah! Let me tell you…
Looking at these beautiful girls in their bathing suits…
And getting paid while doing it...
There are a lot worse ways to make a living!
...
(Hmm, she seems to be thinking about her reply a bit longer.)
Haha! Yeah, I can imagine.
(Let's add a little fuel to the fire.)
It’s a shame Bella is never at the pool, though.
Imagining her in a bathing suit…
Now <b>that</b> really gets my blood pumping.
Wow! Even more than those other girls?
(This should boost her confidence nicely.)
Trust me, you should see her...
It's hard to look at her without getting...certain thoughts.
...
(Another pause.)
Well, who knows?
Maybe she’ll warm up to you.
After all, you’re a very nice guy.
Thanks, that’s very sweet of you.
You’re a nice girl too-
Hmm, I can’t really call you Bella, as it will get a bit confusing.
Haha, yeah.
Can I call you Trixie?
Sure, I like that!
Anyway, I've got some stuff to do.
So I'll be offline for a bit.
But I’d love to hear how things work out for you and Bella next time.
(I’m sure you would…)
See you next time?
It’s a date!
Haha, cool!
Bye, [NAME_1].
Bye, Trixie!
(Bellatrix has gone offline.)
(I wonder if this will change her behaviour in any way...)
(I know it's a bit manipulative of me...)
(But she's not exactly being honest with me either.)
(Anyway, let's return to the world map.)
(I guess I'll just log off for now as well.)
(Maybe I should check if she's online and send her a message?)
(Where do I find my friends list?)
(Incoming message: Bellatrix.)
(Oh!)
(Well, that didn't take long...)
Meet me at the Pixie?
On my way!
(I guess she's eager to find out what I have to say.)
(Let's go meet her.)
A few minutes later...
Over here, [NAME_1]!
Hey, Trixie!
You're looking beautiful as always.
<b>*Blushes*</b> Hee-hee, thanks!
How have you been?
Great! In fact, I have some exciting news to share.
Ooh! What is it?
It turns out you were right about Bella.
She just needed some time to warm up to me.
I finally saw her at the pool...
Really?! And...how did she look?
Amazing!
She has an incredibly sexy body.
Wow! Sexy, huh?
Oh, yeah.
(If this doesn't boost her confidence, I don't know what will.)
(Now, let's see if I can spice things up a bit...)
I noticed it too when I was working out with her.
Oh? You guys worked out together?
(She's playing her part well, I've got to hand her that.)
We did. Her [REL_M1] asked me to help Bella with her workouts.
Which I was very happy to do...
Knowing that these workouts can get pretty...intimate.
Ooh, that sounds kind of hot...
Oh, it was.
Being so close to her I could smell the musky scent of her sweat...
Making eye contact and hearing her little groans...
And if that wasn't enough...
Seeing those beautiful, big breasts right in front of me.
Yeah...it was pretty hot indeed.
Mmm...
I'm getting a bit hot myself, right now...
(Damn...she's so much more open here.)
(Then again, I guess that makes sense...)
(It's part of the appeal of these online games.)
(No one knows who you really are.)
(Well, at least normally they don't...)
It sounds like Bella has made quite the impression on you.
That she has.
(Okay, time to see if this will work...)
So much so, that the other day when I was at the mall...
I bought her a present.
I saw it and immediately thought of her.
Really?! That's so romantic!
(I'm not sure if she would say that if she knew what I bought her...)
Yeah. Although, I'm feeling a bit nervous about giving it to her...
Aww. How come?
I don't know...she might think I'm weird for getting her a present so soon.
It was kind of expensive...and to be honest, I'm a bit worried she won't like it.
Don't be silly! I'm sure she will.
Just tell her it made you think of her.
If a girl doesn't appreciate such a sweet gesture...
I'm sorry, but then she doesn't deserve a present from you in the first place.
You think so?
Of course! What girl wouldn't love that?
I know I would.
(That's good to know...haha!)
Mmm...you know what?
I'm going to take your advice!
I can't chicken out now.
That's the spirit!
All right, I'll let you know how it goes next time we meet.
I'm looking forward to it!
Thanks for the pep talk, Trixie!
Wish me luck!
Good luck, [NAME_1]!
(I return to the world map.)
(And log off.)
(That went well.)
(She's so sweet.)
(She didn't even ask me what kind of present I got her.)
(But that only works to my advantage.)
(There's no way she can refuse the outfit, after what she just said.)
(Next time we work out together, I'll give it to her.)
(I can't wait to find out if she'll actually wear it.)
(The thought of her in that skimpy outfit is turning me on already...)
(Let's play some more Hentai Impact!)
(All right, where should I go next?)
(Oh! Annabelle is taking her morning bath...)
(Wow!)
(What a view...)
(She sits back in the bath.)
(Oh, man...)
(She's giving me quite the show.)
(You have unlocked Annabelle's naked paperdoll animation.)
(She leans back with a sigh and closes her eyes...)
(Giving you an even better look at her beautiful, big breasts.)
(Amazing...)
(Her tits are just...perfect!)
(Anyway, I shouldn't stay in here too long.)
(I don't want to risk getting caught.)
(You leave the corridor and return to the utility closet.)
(The lights are on again!)
(Wait...what the hell is that?!)
(Madeline is standing in front of some kind of wooden contraption.)
(Is that...Annabelle?!)
(Holy crap!)
(This just keeps getting weirder...)
Now, what should I do with you?
I think I deserve to be punished...
Is that right?
And what kind of punishment would be fitting, in your opinion?
A spanking...
Hmm...
*Softly* With a paddle.
Oh? You think you have been that bad, have you?
I do.
I should know better than lying to you, [REL_M3].
Yes. You most certainly should.
(Madeline walks over to a rack filled with straps and paddles.)
Let’s see…
(She carefully examines each item hanging on the rack, her gaze lingering thoughtfully on each one.)
Hmm...
(She looks so hot in that leather outfit...)
Yes, this one will do nicely.
(She removes one of the leather paddles…)
(And walks back to Annabelle.)
Now then…
I have picked the perfect tool for your punishment.
(She presses the paddle against Annabelle's chin.)
Don't you agree?
Yes-
(She forces Annabelle's head up with the paddle.)
Look at me when I am talking to you!
Sorry, [REL_M3].
*Scoffs* It seems I have to teach you some manners as well.
*Softly* Yes, [REL_M3]...
(Madeline walks around to the other side of the contraption.)
Let this be a lesson to you.
(She raises the paddle.)
(And forcefully slaps Annabelle's ass with it.)
That lying…
*Moan* Ahh...
Will not...
*Moan* Ahh!
Be tolerated!
*Moan* Ahh!
(After a while, Madeline stops spanking Annabelle...)
That will be enough for today.
I trust you will improve your behavior?
Yes, [REL_M3]. I will.
Thank you.
Good girl.
Now, let's get you out of this.
(I'll get back to my room before they leave...)
A bit later...
(Damn...)
(That was...)
(...weird.)
(And...)
(...intense.)
(...)
(And kind of hot...if I'm being honest.)
(It feels wrong, but I can't help but being turned on by what I just saw...)
(First Olivia, now Annabelle...)
(And somehow knowing that I played a part in them being punished...)
(It just turns me on even more.)
(Fuck, what's wrong with me?!)
(This doesn't even come close to normal.)
(Then again...)
(Olivia clearly enjoyed it...)
(And Annabelle seemed a bit turned on as well, if anything.)
(Wait...is that why she lied during dinner?!)
(Knowing Madeline would punish her?!)
*Sigh*
(There's definitely something strange going on here.)
(And I really don't know what to make of all this...)
(But one thing's for sure...)
(I want to see more...)
(All right.)
(Let's see if she's ready...)
*Knock*
*Muffled* Hello?
Annabelle, it's [NAME_1]. 
Are you ready to go to your art class?
*Muffled* Oh! Y-Yeah...I'll be right there!
(That's weird...)
(She sounds surprised.)
(I thought she'd be expecting me...)
A bit later...
(Silence fills the air.)
(I guess she's not very talkative.)
(Come to think of it, she's hardly said more than a few words to me since we've met.)
(She just stays locked up in her room most of the time.)
(Then again, with my father just having passed away...)
(I can imagine she's upset and would rather be alone.)
(Or maybe she's just shy...)
(Of course, seeing me naked probably didn't help much either...)
(Let's see if I can get her to open up a bit.)
Are you looking forward to going to art class again?
Huh?
Oh! Yes, I am.
Did you forget I was taking you?
Uhm?
You seemed a bit surprised earlier...
When I came to pick you up?
Oh! N-No...I was just-
(She trails off.)
I guess I lost track of time...
*Softly* Sorry...
Oh, no! It's no problem!
(She was just...what?)
(It seems she's not comfortable talking to me about it.)
(At least not yet...)
(Maybe I should just give it some time.)
(I'm sure she'll open up once she gets to know me a bit better.)
(Oh. I think we're here.)
This is the place, right?
Huh?
(She looks outside.)
Oh! Yes.
All right then. I'll be waiting here.
Let me get the door for you.
Oh, thank you...
A few hours later...
(She should be out any minute now.)
(It's getting a little chilly...)
(Ah!)
(There she is.)
(As she comes down the stairs you can't help but admire her curvy body.)
(Damn...)
(She's got quite the hourglass figure...)
(Those thick thighs...)
(Small waist...)
(And huge-)
(Crap! There I go again...)
(I guess I'm still not used to the idea of having three [REL_S1+].)
(She walks up to you.)
Hey, Annabelle.
Ready to go?
Uhm...yeah.
Great! Let's get you home then.
On the way back...
(Is it just me?)
(Or is she this quiet with everyone?)
So, how was your art class?
Uhm...it was nice.
...
(You echo her silence in an attempt to get more out of her.)
...
(And it works.)
*Softly* The teacher said I showed talent...
Wow! That's great, Annabelle!
(Her face lights up.)
T-Thank you!
Maybe you'll be a famous painter one day!
*Softly* Oh, I don't know about that...
(She averts her eyes again.)
(Well, at least I got her talking...)
(It's not much, but it's a start.)
(I guess I'll just have to take it one step at a time with her.)
A bit later...
(You arrive back at the mansion.)
We're here!
Oh! Uhm...thanks for the ride.
Don't mention it! It was my-
(Before you can finish your sentence, she gets out of the car and goes inside.)
...pleasure.
(You follow her inside.)
(Hmm, it seems she went straight back to her room.)
(You go upstairs.)
(And stop at her bedroom door.)
(Yep, looks like it.)
(Now that I think about it...I wonder what she's doing in there all the time?)
(If I could learn what her hobbies are, it might help me get closer to her.)
(Maybe I can find out a bit more about her by talking to the other girls?)
(Anyway, it's getting late.)
(All right.)
(Let's see if she's ready...)
*Knock*
*Muffled* Hello?
Annabelle, it's [NAME_1]. 
Are you ready to go to your art class?
*Muffled* I'll be right there!
A bit later...
(Just like the first time, silence fills the air.)
(Maybe some small talk will loosen her up a bit.)
So, are you looking forward to art class?
Huh? Oh!
Yeah...I guess.
I just hope my teacher won't be upset with me.
Upset? What makes you think that?
I...didn't do my homework assignment...
(That doesn't sound like her.)
Oh? Why not?
Because...
(She trails off.)
It's just too...difficult for me.
Maybe I'm not cut out to be an artist after all...
(That's weird.)
(Last week she was so excited because the teacher said she had talent.)
(I wonder what made her doubt herself like this.)
Maybe you should just talk to your teacher about this.
And explain why this is so difficult for you.
You think so?
Of course. You're still learning, right?
And your teacher said you have a talent for this.
I'm sure he'll try to help you.
That's his job, after all.
I guess you're right.
I'll try talking to him.
Thanks, [NAME_1].
(Yes! I actually managed to give her some advice!)
Anytime!
Later that evening...
(Hmm, she's running a bit late...)
(Should I go check if everything's all right?)
(Oh, there she is!)
Unfortunately, I can’t make an exception for you, Annabelle.
That wouldn’t be fair to the other students.
(That guy's her teacher?)
(Why does he look so familiar?)
I...understand, Ricky.
Listen, you show great potential, Annabelle!
But you can’t become a true artist unless you overcome your shyness.
I know…
You can do this.
Just ask someone you feel comfortable with.
(I wonder what they are talking about.)
Right…
Anyway, I gotta run, I’m taking my wife to a very exclusive hotel for the weekend!
My brother renovated the place, so he got me a juicy discount.
See you next week!
Bye.
(She walks up to you, looking defeated.)
Hey, are you okay?
Mm-hm.
(...)
Let’s go home.
A bit later…
(She's clearly upset.)
(And you can't help but feel responsible.)
(There has to be something I can do to make her feel better.)
So, was that your teacher you were just talking to?
Yeah.
But it didn't help?
Not really.
Oh, I’m sorry to hear that.
(That’s probably the last time she’s going to follow my advice.)
What did he say?
That he can’t make an exception for me.
*Softly* And that I should ask someone I’m…comfortable with.
Ask them what?
(She startles, as if she only just realized she said that out loud.) 
To…uhm…help with…my homework assignment.
What’s the assignment?
Maybe I can help!
(A crimson blush spreads across her face.)
N-No!
I mean…I don’t think so...
It’s…complicated.
Well, what is it?
(She pauses, as if considering how to respond.)
Uhm...we have to make a...nude painting.
(Oh! So that’s what this is all about?!)
I asked both Olly and Vicky to model for me, but they don’t want to do it.
So now…I will fail the assignment.
(The words leave your mouth before you realize it.)
I could pose for you!
*Gasp* Y-You?!
(What the hell, she’s already seen me naked anyway.)
I-I don’t think-
Unless you don’t want to, of course!
No! I-I mean, I do! Uhm, but...
Wouldn't that be…weird?
Why? It’s just a painting, right?
I guess…
Look, I know how important this is to you.
So if it will help you pass your assignment, I will gladly pose for you.
That’s...very sweet of you, [NAME_1].
Thank you so much!
No problem!
A bit later…
(You arrive at the mansion.)
Just let me know when you want me to pose for you, okay?
Okay.
Good night, [NAME_1].
Good night.
(She goes inside, looking much happier.)
(I’ve never posed nude before…)
(But I’m glad I’m able to help her out.)
(Besides, how hard can it be?)
(Right?)
(Anyway, let's go inside.)
(All right.)
(Let's see if she's ready...)
*Knock*
*Muffled* Hello?
Annabelle, it's [NAME_1]. 
Are you ready to go to your art class?
*Muffled* I'll be right there!
A bit later...
(All right.)
(Let's see if she's ready...)
*Knock*
*Muffled* Hello?
Annabelle, it's [NAME_1]. 
Are you ready to go to your art class?
*Muffled* I'll be right there!
A few hours later...
(You arrive back at the mansion.)
Uhm...thanks for the ride..
You're welcome.
(She gets out of the car and goes inside the mansion.)
(Hmm, that was a bit...uneventful.)
(Oh, well.)
(You follow her inside.)
Meanwhile...
([NAME_1] still isn't here...)
(I'm going to be late for my art class.)
(I hope nothing bad happened to him!)
(Maybe I should check if [REL_M2] knows where he is...)
She started working for Madeline only recently. She seems to be quite reserved but friendly.
cooking
cleaning
?
?
Maybe I should spy on her when she's cleaning my room.
I don't quite know what to think of him.
*Yawn*
(Ahh! I slept like a log.)
(I can’t remember the last time I fell asleep without worrying about all the problems that needed fixing.)
(But now, those problems are a thing of the past!)
(And to think it’s all thanks to my old man getting killed.)
(I can’t help but think there is some kind of poetic justice in that.)
(Anyway, I better get ready.)
A few minutes later...
(According to the schedule Rebecca sent me, I’m supposed to take Victoria to her kickboxing class at 19:00.)
(At least we share a common interest, I guess.)
(I might be able to use that to break the ice a bit...)
(Either way, I'll need to make sure she gets there on time.)
(Madeline was very clear about that.)
(I can't afford to fuck this up!)
(Not when I finally got the chance to get out of this mess...)
(Madeline also told me to stay out of their way, so I guess that means I have the rest of the day to myself.)
(I should have a look around the mansion. After all, I’ll be living here for a-)
(The door to your bedroom suddenly opens.)
(Huh?)
*Gasp*
(A beautiful young woman wearing a maid outfit, is standing in the doorway.)
I’m so sorry! I didn’t know someone was staying in this-
(Her eyes drift down towards your exposed torso.)
*Under her breath* …room.
(She seems to have lost her train of thought for a moment.)
Can I help you?
(Her eyes shoot back up and her cheeks turn red.)
Oh! S-Sorry, I was just…I mean-
I’m new here...I thought this was the guest room.
(She’s new here too? Interesting.)
It is, I just moved in yesterday.
My name is [NAME_1], by the way.
(She seems to relax a little.)
Nice to meet you, [NAME_1]. I’m Kate.
So, uhm...are you related to Miss Caine? Or are you here for business?
Both, actually. Her husband is- 
Actually. Her husband is- 
<i>Was</i>…my father.
Oh! I’m sorry for your loss!
(I’m not.)
Thanks. To be honest, I didn't really know him.
Oh.
(There is an awkward silence for a moment.)
Uhm...did you say you were here for business as well?
Yeah. Miss Caine hired me to escort her and the girls to their appointments.
Just to keep them safe, until this whole thing blows over.
Really? Wow! So you’re a bodyguard?!
Yes, I am.
(Kate's eyes briefly flicker downward again.)
(Is she checking me out?)
*Clears throat*
(Her cheeks flush crimson red again, and she forces herself to meet your gaze.)
That’s, uhm...very cool.
Anyway, I’ll…uhm…get out of your hair, so you can get dressed.
It was…very nice to meet you, [NAME_1].
I hope to see...more of you, later.
(Heh. This one’s a bit of a flirt it seems.)
Yeah, nice meeting you too.
See you later.
Bye.
(Mmm.)
(I wouldn't mind getting to know her a bit better...)
(She seems...fun.)
(Right. Let's get some more clothes on and have a look around.)
(Kate is cleaning the staircase.)
Hey, Kate.
Oh! Hey, [NAME_1].
What's up?
Hey, Kate.
Oh! Hey, [NAME_1].
I'm a bit busy right now...
Do you mind if we talk later?
Oh, sure! No problem.
Thanks.
Hey, Kate.
Oh! Hey, [NAME_1].
I was just getting Olivia's laundry...
But I've got my lunch break at 14:00, if you want to talk later?
Oh, okay! I'll talk to you later then.
Bye.
(Kate is on her lunch break.)
Hey, Kate.
Oh! Hey, [NAME_1].
What's up?
(Hmm? I think she left her door unlocked!)
(As you turn the door handle, Kate comes out of Annabelle's bedroom.)
Oh! Hey, [NAME_1]!
Were you're looking for Annabelle?
I, uhm...yeah, I was.
She's probably outside painting.
Oh, okay.
Now, if you'll excuse me...
I better get her room cleaned before she comes back.
Yeah. Of course.
(She goes back inside and closes the door behind her.)
(I can't go in there.)
(Kate's cleaning the room.)
(Kate is cleaning your room.)
I hope I didn't make too much of a mess.
Oh! Hey, [NAME_1].
Don't worry, I've seen much worse.
So, what's up?
(What should we talk about?)
me
Olivia
Annabelle
Victoria
Madeline
John
Rebecca
you
So, care to tell me a bit more about yourself?
Sure, what do you want to know?
Uhm...I know you're a bodyguard...
But that's about it...
How did you get this job, for instance?
Well, it started with a phone call from the police...
Several minutes later...
Wow! So you didn't even know about Miss Caine and the girls until recently?
Nope.
That must have been quite a shock.
Trust me, it was.
I'm still getting used to the whole situtation, if I'm honest.
I can imagine...
Thanks for sharing that with me, [NAME_1].
I appreciate it.
I only started working here the day before you arrived...
So there's not much I could tell you about her.
But she seems like a sweet girl.
And I like her positive energy.
I don't know her very well.
I think she's a bit shy.
I haven't seen her come out of her room a lot...
She seems to be to very confident.
Perhaps a bit full of herself?
Although, I can't say that I blame her...
If I had her looks I would be too.
What are you talking about?
You are easily as pretty as she is, if not more.
[NAME_1]!
If I didn't know any better...
I'd say you are flirting with me!
I haven't really talked to her yet...
Didn't you have a job interview?
I did, but it was with Rebecca.
I see.
(I guess that makes sense, since Rebecca would be the one training her.)
I wouldn't know what to tell you...
I've never met him.
All I know is he owned some big tech company.
Don't you think she's a bit too...
Uhm...how should I put it?
Uptight?
Yes! Thank you!
She seems to take her job very seriously...
A bit <i>too</i> seriously, if you ask me.
But don't tell her I said that!
And what exactly would you like to know about me?
Oh, you know...
The usual.
Any hobbies?
Pets?
Are you in a relationship?
*Laughs* The usual, huh?
Well, let's see...
I like reading and dancing.
I have a cat, named Furball.
And no...
I'm not in a relationship at the moment.
It's been fun talking to you, [NAME_1]...
But I really should get back to work.
Of course.
I'll see you around.
I'm sure you will...
I'll see you around.
I'm you sure you will...
(All right, this should do the trick...)
(You throw the toilet roll in and flush the toilet.)
(Perfect!)
(It’s completely clogged now.)
(I should go get Kate.)
(You go upstairs and knock on Annabelle’s bedroom door.)
*Knock*
Oh, hey [NAME_1].
What’s up?
Well, there’s a bit of a…situation in the downstairs bathroom.
Uhm...?
It seems to be clogged.
Oh...
I’ll look at it as soon as I finish cleaning Annabelle’s room.
(That won’t do.)
I think it’s rather... urgent, it was already overflowing a minute ago.
And I think Miss Caine wouldn’t want the water to spill into the entrance hall...
*Gasp* Oh, crap!
I better go right away.
(She rushes down the stairs.)
(That should buy me some time.)
(As soon as she is out of sight, you sneak into Annabelle’s bedroom.)
(Wow! That’s…not what I expected.)
(Nice gaming setup though…)
(You take a closer look at her screens.)
(Great! She still has the game running!)
(And it’s showing her login screen!)
("Bellatrix, level 72 succubus.")
(Hmm, interesting choice...)
(She must have spent a crazy amount of time to be such a high level.)
(I guess that explains why she's always in here...)
(Her current location is some place called "The Pervy Pixie".)
(I don't know what that is, but it does say it's in the capital.)
(I think I should be able to find her now.)
(Let's get out of here before Kate returns.)
(You quickly leave her bedroom.)
(Just as you close the door behind you, Kate comes back up the stairs, looking flustered.)
(Crap! Did she see me coming out of Annabelle’s room?)
Oh…you’re still here?
Yeah…did you…manage the fix the problem?
I did. There was a whole toilet roll inside of it!
No way?!
Yeah, no idea how that happened…
Maybe one of the girls did it as a prank?
You know, because you’re new here?
Hmm....that wouldn’t surprise me.
Anyway, thanks for letting me know.
I better get back to cleaning Annabelle’s room.
Right...see you later.
(I think I got away with it.)
(I do feel bad for doing that to her...)
(Sorry, Kate...your sacrifice will not be in vain!)
(Nothing to see-)
Yes, the day after I started working here.
(Huh? Is that Kate?)
(What the fuck?!)
(Why is she going through my bag?!)
Yeah, he claims to be his son.
Neither did I.
(She is talking to someone on the phone.)
Yeah, a bit too much of a coincidence, if you ask me...
Exactly.
But we have to be careful...
Having him around is going to complicate things.
Yes, that might be smart.
Shit! I think someone's coming!
I gotta go!
She puts away your bag and leaves the room...
(What the hell!)
(What was that all about?!)
(And who was she talking to?)
(Either way, it seems she is not who she pretends to be...)
(I need to find out why she's here.)
(Could this have anything to do with my father?)
(Or maybe she's the one blackmailing me?)
(Hmm....should I warn Madeline about her?)
(No.)
(I need to find out more first.)
(But I'll make sure to keep a close eye on her.)
(I can't let her know that I'm onto her though.)
*Sigh*
(This job is getting more complicated every day...)
(As you sit down, the receptionist approaches you.)
Hello, sir.
Welcome to Bishop and Fuller Technologies.
My name is Lisa.
Nice to meet you, Lisa. I'm [NAME_1].
Nice to meet you too, [NAME_1].
Would you like something to drink while you wait for Miss Caine?
No, thank you. I'm good for now.
All right. If there's anything you need, please feel free to let me know.
I will. Thank you.
(She smiles and returns to her desk.)
(She seems nice.)
(END)
Hey, Lisa.
Hello, [NAME_1].
How can I help you?
Never mind.
Madeline is a very strict woman. She is quite intimidating and <i>very</i> protective of her girls.
?
?
Board meeting (14:30 - 16:30)
Board meeting (14:30 - 16:30)
I need to take her to her board meetings on Tuesday and Thursday at 14:00.
She likes to drink a glass of wine in the backyard in the evening.
She works out in the basement every morning.
Her room is unlocked when Rebecca prepares her evening bath.
Maybe I can sneak into her room when Rebecca is cleaning the bathroom.
The book has to be in her room somewhere! I just need to look around very carefully.
I could spy on her when she takes her evening bath.
Maybe I should join her by the pool in the evening for some wine.
In the evening, she likes to read in her room.
Let's join her for another glass of wine.
I'll just have to tolerate his presence until this whole thing blows over.
He doesn't seem to be much like his father...
Meanwhile...
(What is keeping him so long?!)
(I'm late for my board meeting!)
(This is completely unacceptable!)
(Madeline is doing her morning workout.)
(You notice her form is a bit off.)
(She might end up injuring herself if she keeps doing that.)
(Maybe I can offer her some guidance.)
Excuse me, Miss Caine?
(She's wearing a very tight top that accentuates her ample breasts.)
What is it, [NAME_1]?
I'm in the middle of my workout.
Yes, about that...
I noticed some minor flaws in your form, and was wondering if I could offer you some advice?
(She gets an agitated look on her face.)
*Scoffs* Oh? So now you're a personal trainer as well?
No, but I do have a lot of experience-
I can handle myself just fine.
Now, if you don't mind?
As you wish, Miss Caine.
(She resumes her workout.)
(Well, I tried...)
(She gets back on the mat.)
Well? Go on then. Show me.
(Oh?)
Of course.
(You kneel down beside her.)
Let's start by assuming the initial pose...
(You support her as she moves back into her previous position.)
Now lift your pelvis up a bit more, so that your body forms a straight line from head to heels.
(You gently push her body upwards, guiding her into the correct position.)
Perfect!
(You glance to the side.)
(Look at that big, round ass...)
(Now's your chance...)
(You move your right hand to her stomach.)
(Her abs are quite tight...)
Now, keep your core engaged.
(Fuck! Am I really going to do this?!)
(If I do, I'll probably get fired...)
(Then again, if I don't do it, I might get fired as well...)
(I guess I don’t have much of a choice…)
(You take a deep breath...)
(And move your hand to her ass.)
(Damn! It feels so firm!)
(You try to sound as casual as you can...)
Make sure to tighten your butt as you hold this position.
(Her muscles tense, but you're not sure if it's out of shock or if she's just following your instructions.)
...
(She suddenly turns her head towards you.)
[NAME_1]…
(Her voice is cool.)
(Here it comes…)
I must admit...
I do feel the difference.
(Huh?!)
(That was not the reaction I was expecting...)
Oh! That’s...
...good.
(You both get back up.)
It seems I underestimated you.
Maybe I should...rely...on your help more often...
(That's it?!)
(Not even a comment about me touching her ass?!)
Yeah. Of course!
Feel free to ask me whenever you need help.
I will. Thank you, [NAME_1].
(Was that...a smile?!)
Now, if you'll excuse me...
I should get ready for work.
Of course, Miss Caine.
(As she leaves the basement, you breathe a sigh of relief.)
(I don't know how... but I feel like I just dodged a huge bullet... somehow.)
(She didn't react to me touching her...at all.)
(Maybe Madeline isn't as uptight as I thought?)
(Or maybe...)
(The blackmailer was right...)
(Maybe she actually liked it?)
(But how would the blackmailer even know that?)
(Unless...Madeline herself is the blackmailer!)
(But to what end?)
(That doesn't make any sense either...)
*Sigh*
(It's like my list of potential suspects is only getting longer...)
(But I guess in this particular case...)
(I should just count my blessings.)
(She made it very clear that she doesn't want my help.)
(So I better not distract her again.)
(At least not until I earn her trust a bit more...)
(There's nothing more I can do here in the current version.)
(But I'm sure that will change soon...)
(Madeline is having breakfast with Olivia.)
Good morning, Miss Caine.
Good morning, [NAME_1].
Help yourself to some breakfast. 
There’s fresh coffee in the pot as well.
Thank you.
(I should probably let her finish her breakfast in peace.)
(As you enter Madeline’s office, she seems agitated.)
Hello, Miss Caine. How are-
Is this urgent?
Not particularly. I just wanted to-
In case you haven't noticed, [NAME_1]...I am extremely busy.
So unless something important comes up, please refrain from disturbing me.
Of course, Miss Caine. My apologies.
(You leave the office and close the door behind you.)
Seriously?!
What the hell is wrong with you?!
(Madeline is having a glass of wine.)
(You notice it’s almost empty.)
(Maybe I can offer to refill her glass?)
(It might help break the ice a bit.)
(You approach her.)
Good evening, Miss Caine.
Oh, [NAME_1]. Good evening.
Would you like a refill?
(She looks at her glass, seemingly surprised to find it almost empty.)
(She pauses as she considers your offer.)
Actually, yes...please do.
(She takes a last sip...)
(Then hands you the empty glass.)
I’ll be right back.
A few minutes later…
Here you go, Miss Caine.
(She takes the glass from you.)
Enjoy your wine and have a good night.
(She gives you a puzzled look.)
... 
*Softly* Thank you. 
(You walk away, smiling to yourself.)
(That went pretty well.)
(You approach her.)
Good evening, Miss Caine.
Good evening, [NAME_1].
Would you like some more wine?
(She looks at her almost empty glass.)
Yes, I would.
(She takes a last sip...)
(Then hands you the empty glass.)
I’ll be right back.
A few minutes later…
Here you go, Miss Caine.
(She takes the glass from you.)
Enjoy your wine and have a good night.
Thank you.
Good night.
(Hmm...is she warming up to me, or is it just my imagination?)
(You approach her.)
Good evening, Miss Caine.
Oh...good evening, [NAME_1].
Some more wine?
(She looks at her almost empty glass.)
Yes, please.
(She takes a last sip...)
(And hands you the empty glass.)
Pour yourself some as well.
You can keep me company.
(Wait...did she just invite me to join her for a glass of wine?!)
(No.)
(It wasn't so much an invitation as an order.)
(Still, it's something...I guess.)
(Besides, I wouldn't mind a glass of some, probably expensive, red wine.)
Sure. I’ll be right back.
A few minutes later…
(She just stares at you, without saying a word...)
(And then takes a sip of her wine.)
(Feeling a bit uncomfortable, you imitate her.)
(Oh, wow!)
(You've had some good wine before, but never anything like this.)
(Madeline is staring at you again.)
Well?
(Oh...she wants to know what I think?)
(You try to sound sophisticated.)
It's very smooth, with just the right amount of fruity sweetness.
And I like how it's balanced by a subtle hint of oakiness.
Oh?
Very good.
I didn't know you were a wine aficionado?
Well, I don't know about that...
But I do appreciate a nice red.
Especially one this exquisite.
I see.
I will keep that in mind.
Now then...
(You approach her.)
Good evening, Miss Caine.
Good evening, [NAME_1].
Will you join me for a glass of wine?
(What should I say?)
I would love to!
Maybe some other time.
Very well.
A few minutes later…
As you wish.
Have a good night.
(I already talked to her.)
(Let's not annoy her.)
(You enter Madeline’s bedroom.)
(She is reading on her bed, wearing a very sexy nightgown.)
What the hell do you think you’re doing in my room?!
I'm sorry-
Get out of here, now!
Of course, Miss Caine. My apologies.
(That wasn’t very smart…)
Are you serious?!
That does it!
My office! Now!
(She is reading on her bed, wearing a very sexy nightgown.)
(Your eyes are immediately drawn to her breasts.)
(Damn...they really are magnificent.)
Hmm?
What do you think you're doing in <b>MY</b> bedroom?!
(What should I do?)
(Wish her good night.)
(Flirt with her.)
Actually...I just wanted to say good night.
(Her expression softens.)
Oh.
...
*Softly* Good night.
(You leave her bedroom.)
(Well, she didn't yell at me...)
(That's some progress, at least.)
(I already talked to her.)
(Let's not overdo it.)
(What should we talk about?)
me
Olivia
Annabelle
Victoria
you
John
Rebecca
Kate
I’m still getting used to the idea of you being John’s son.
I see the resemblance, of course…
But you are nothing like him.
How so?
(Her voice softens, a hint of vulnerability creeping in.)
He was selfish, arrogant and he had a bad temper.
(She pauses, searching your face.)
So far, you seem…quite the opposite of that.
(Did she just give me a compliment?!)
Thank you.
Olivia is the sweetest thing.
She has a positive attitude and is a good student.
And even when I need to-
(She pauses, as if catching herself.)
Correct her…
(Was she about to say something else?)
(Oh, I know all about what you're doing downstairs...)
She understands it’s for her own good.
Annabelle is both incredibly intelligent and talented.
Unfortunately, she also has a tendency to be a bit…lazy.
She could accomplish so much…
If only she would apply herself a bit more.
Instead, she stays in her room all day, playing video games and reading comic books.
I have tried so many ways to motivate that girl.
But I just can’t seem to get through to her.
Not even by-
(She stops herself mid-sentence.)
(Not even by…what?)
(Not even by spanking her in your secret discipline room, you mean?)
Anyway...
Hopefully it’s just a phase.
Victoria is…quite the handful.
Always expecting everyone to do as she tells them.
Yet absolutely hates being told what to do herself.
(I wonder who she got that from?)
I’m sure she’ll make a great leader someday…
But as long as she’s living under my roof, she needs to understand that I am the one in charge.
I try to be patient with her, but sometimes she really tests my limits.
That girl is just too stubborn for her own good.
I made her help the maids do some chores once.
Just to teach her some discipline…
Did it work?
*Scoffs* She flat-out refused.
Knowing full well what would happen if she did.
But she didn’t care.
(Her eyes stare into the distance and her voice trails off.)
It didn’t even seem to faze her…
What didn’t?
Huh? What?
Oh…
I...took away her phone for an entire month.
You know how these young girls are when it comes to their social media.
(What is she not telling me?)
(Something tells me that was not how she punished Victoria...) 
But enough about that.
How are you holding up?
Holding up?
With everything that has happened...
It’s quite a lot to deal with, isn't it?
Oh.
It is true that things have been a bit…stressful lately.
There are a lot of arrangements that need to be made before selling the company.
And John wasn’t particularly good at keeping a structured administration.
Of course, the board told me they could handle it.
But they can’t be trusted.
Not with this much money.
*Softly* My father's money...
But as soon as B&F Technologies is sold, things should return to normal.
And we will be able to put this whole thing behind us.
I'd rather not talk about him right now.
I understand.
Rebecca is great.
She has been with us a long time.
And she is the only one who worked for us that never took any crap from John.
(I can’t say that surprises me.)
Yeah, she doesn’t seem like a person to take crap from…
Well, anyone.
(Except from Madeline, of course.)
Yes, she’s a tough woman.
*Sofly* But she has a gentle side to her as well...
Really, what makes you say that?
(She ignores your question.)
Anyway, enough about Rebecca.
Kate? She has only been with us for a short while.
When Joanne resigned, the agency sent her as a replacement.
Joanne?
Our previous maid.
She was with us almost as long as Rebecca.
But when John died, she resigned the very next day.
That’s…peculiar.
She said she couldn’t deal with the stress anymore.
And you believed her?
I didn’t care either way.
Never trusted her in the first place.
It was John who hired her.
*Scoffs* Clearly because of her "extensive experience"...
I see.
(If you ask me, this Joanne seems rather suspicious…)
(Could she have been involved with my father’s death somehow?)
Oh, it's getting a bit late, [NAME_1].
(She finishes her wine with one final sip.)
I should get ready for bed.
(Maybe it's because of the wine, or maybe you're just tired...)
(But for a split second, you zone out and let your eyes drift down.)
...
(What should I do?)
(Focus!)
(Compliment her legs.) - <b>Not implemented yet.</b>
(You quickly look up and meet her eyes.)
(She raises an eyebrow, but doesn't say anything.)
Thank you...for the company.
Oh, it was my pleasure!
(Crap! I'm sure she saw that...)
Good night, [NAME_1].
Good night, Miss Caine.
Say something...
It's getting pretty late.
Thank you for the wine, Miss Caine.
Oh...you're welcome.
Good night then.
Good night.
(Oh! Madeline is taking her evening bath...)
(Hmm...she appears to be lost in thought.)
(She reaches for a glass of wine on the edge of the bathtub...)
(And looks at it pensively.)
*Gulp*
(Wow! She just finished the entire glass in one sip...)
(Madeline leans back with a sigh and closes her eyes...)
(And you can't help but admire her impressive bosom.)
(Holy crap...)
(She really has a great pair of tits!)
(You have unlocked Madeline's naked paperdoll animation.)
(Her back must be killing her...)
(Anyway...)
(I think it's time for me to get out of here.)
(You leave the corridor and return to the utility closet.)
Hello, Miss Caine. Are you ready to go to your board meeting?
Punctual. Good.
Get the car ready. I'll be there in a few minutes.
As you wish.
A bit later...
Coming up next, a compelling twist in the murder case everyone is talking about.
*Sigh*
(Not that again.)
(You lean in to change the station.)
Wait, leave that on.
Oh, sorry.
Could Aron Fuller, co-founder of B&F Technologies, be linked to the murder of his business partner and tech mogul, John Bishop?
An anonymous source revealed a recent buyout offer turned long-time friends into bitter enemies, when Fuller was eager to accept, but Bishop refused.
Was there really a buyout offer? And did Bishop, by refusing to sign the deal, unwittingly sign his own death warrant instead?
We reached out to B&F Technologies for a statement, but they declined to comment pending the ongoing investigation.
Tune in to MNS news for more updates on this murder mystery.
Now, over to you, Patricia, for the weather.
*Mumbles* Vultures.
Do you think there is any truth to these allegations?
*Scoffs* Fuller wouldn’t hurt a fly.
The other board members, however…I’m not so sure.
Wait…the same board members you’re meeting in a few minutes?!
If you genuinely suspect one of them could be the killer, you should consider cancelling the meeting. 
Or at the very least, allow me to-
And what are they going to do in a room full of people?
Besides, the list of potential killers is endless. 
Your...father...made enemies everywhere he went. 
(She utters the word "father" as if it leaves a bitter taste in her mouth.)
That was the kind of man he was. 
(I can’t argue with that.)
(I wonder why she married him in the first place...)
(There’s no hint of affection or grief in her voice at all.)
And if his refusal to sell the company truly was the reason he was killed, that won’t be an issue any longer.
Oh? Why is that?
(She pauses.)
Never mind.
We’re here. Drive up to the main building.
There is a parking space reserved in my name.
Okay.
(Hmm…did she agree to sell the company?)
(And if so…wouldn’t that make her a suspect as well?)
A few minutes later…
The meeting is on the top floor of the main building. 
You can wait for me in the lobby. 
(You follow her inside.)
I should be back in about two hours.
If you need anything, just ask the receptionist.
Thank you, I will.
(All right. I guess I'll just make myself comfortable.)
(There's Madeline.)
I'm ready to leave.
All right. Let's go.
A bit later...
*Mumbles*...complete waste of time...
Is...everything okay, Miss Caine?
(Her head snaps up.)
All these people do is talk, talk, talk.
As if I've got nothing better to do!
*Under her breath* Even in death, that man is nothing but trouble.
(It seems she didn't care much for my father either.)
(I'm starting to think that she cares even less about his death than I do.)
(She looks up and meets your eyes.)
What?
Oh! It's...nothing.
If you have something to say, say it.
(Fine.)
Well, if I’m being honest…
You don’t seem very upset that he’s gone.
I’m not.
But you were married for a long time, right? You must have loved him at-
*Scoffs* Love?
Our marriage was never about love.
*Softly* At least not to him...
(She pauses.)
My parents had money and I was…young and naïve.
...
(She looks down at her laptop.)
(It must be difficult for her to talk about this.)
(You decide to let it rest and focus your attention on the road.)
(...)
(She sighs, as if having made up her mind.)
As soon as we got married, he convinced me to invest in his startup.
And over the years, he kept asking me for more...
Until one day, when he finally found success…
He lost interest in me.
(Damn…I guess me and my mom aren’t the only ones that were hurt by him.)
I’m sorry to hear that.
Like I said, I was young and naïve.
(I try to lighten the mood a bit.)
At least you made a good investment. The company was a huge success, right? 
It was.
But it was never about the money for me. I had plenty of that to begin with.
All I wanted was a family. A father for my girls.
But that was never his ambition.
Why didn't you get a divorce?
(She pauses again, as if she's considering if she should continue.)
Because of my father...
He warned me about marrying John…
That he was only after our money.
But I was too blind to see it.
I convinced my father he was wrong about him.
And even got him to fund John's startup.
But soon after, I realized my father was right all along.
Of course, I was too proud to admit it...
As for John…I’m sure he would have left me long ago if I didn’t own half of his stock.
So, we kept up the facade…for all those years.
And we just lived our separate lives.
Me, taking care of the girls...
Me, mentoring the girls...
Him, constantly going on his “business trips”. 
Which to him, were just another excuse to bed any woman he could get into his hotel room.
(I guess some people never change.)
He couldn’t care less about me or the girls.
He didn’t even show up for their birthdays.
(You arrive back at the mansion.)
All he ever cared about was himself…and his damned company.
So, no. I am not upset that he is dead.
Not in the slightest.
In fact, I’m glad to finally be rid of him.
(I can't say that I blame her.)
Now, if you will excuse me, I have matters to attend to.
(She closes her laptop and reaches for the door.)
Miss Caine...
(She meets your eyes in the rear-view mirror.)
I'm sorry for how my father treated you...
...and your daughters.
He clearly didn't deserve you.
I...
*Softly* Thank you.
(And with that she leaves the car and goes inside the mansion.)
(She really opened up to me...)
(I'm starting to understand why she acts the way she does.)
(Things haven't been easy for her.)
(Perhaps with my old man gone, she can finally pick up the pieces and move on with her life.)
(You head inside, pondering this side of Madeline you hadn't seen before.)
Hello, Miss Caine. Are you ready to go to your board meeting?
Yes.
Get the car ready. I'll be there in a few minutes.
As you wish.
A bit later...
(This might be a good opportunity to get to know her a bit better.)
(I'm sure there will be some interesting dialog options here in a future update.)
A few hours later...
(All right, we're back at the mansion.)
(Let's head inside.)
You've been around. Having many years of experience working as a bodyguard, nothing gets by you or surprises you anymore. At least that's what you think...
being a bodyguard
working out
women
social media
Maybe I should just go to my room and relax a little.
The blackmailer said I should expose myself to Olivia.
I have a feeling I should focus on Olivia for now.
I think I should go to my room.
This time, the blackmailer wants me to expose myself to Annabelle.
I'm sure the blackmailer will contact me again eventually.
The blackmailer wants me to grab Madeline's ass.
I should spend some more time at the mansion.
I need to look around the mansion and find out where I can use that key.
I should investigate the utility closet.
I need to figure out the passcode that unlocks the metal door in the utility room.
I'll go back to utility closet after Rebecca has gone home for the day.
I should return the book of Greed to the study.
I should return the book of Sloth to the study.
I should return the book of Envy to the study.
I should return the book of Pride to the study.
I should return the book of Lust to the study.
I should have dinner with the girls.
I should visit Ruslan to pay off my debt to him.
I wonder what the blackmailer wants next.
Man of the House
Complete the introduction.
Book collector
Return all books of Sin to the bookcase.
Code breaker
Figure out the passcode for the metal door.
Peeping Tom
Spy on each of the girls while they are in the bathroom.
Art Aficionado
Inspect each of the themed paintings in the mansion.
Brawler
Win 5 fights
Peak Performance
Maximize your power, skill, and endurance.
I don't see the point of that.
I don't think so.
That won't work.
The door is locked.
*Yawn*
(Ugh...I'm exhausted.)
(I better get back to the mansion.)
A bit later...
(Let's get some sleep.)
(Let's get some sleep.)
(I've got another early day tomorrow.)
(Should I call it a day?)
Yes, go to sleep.
No, not yet.
(Ahh! Nothing like a comfortable bed after a long day.)
(Let's get some well-deserved rest.)
The next morning...
*Yawn*
(I wonder what today has in store for me...)
(Well, only one way to find out!)
(It's a bit early for that.)
(Maybe later.)
(I need to finish my plan first...)
(I think I had enough exercise for one day.)
(I didn't bring any workout gear.)
(I guess I need to go shopping...)
(I don't have any swim trunks.)
(I guess I need to go shopping...)
(I don't have boxing gloves.)
(I guess I need to go shopping...)
Let's see.
Mr...
"[NAME_1] Bishop."
Play the introduction story?<BR>(Note: Recommended for new players.)
(Yes, I want to know what the story is about.)
(No, I already know the background story.)
"Close protection specialist."
"Threat assessments, security consulting, personal protection."
So uhm...
...
What exactly does that mean?
It means I protect people.
(Or used to, at least.)
Ah! Like a bodyguard?
(Where did they find this guy?)
Yes. Like a bodyguard.
Wow! Now that's something you don't hear very often.
That must be so exciting!
I bet you have some great stories to-
*Clears throat* About my father?
Oh...right.
*Mumbles* Uhm...where was I?
Ah, yes!
So are you absolutely sure there's no one you can think of who would have wanted to hurt your father?
(Aside from me?)
Like I said, I haven't seen him or talked to him since I was a little kid.
I can't even tell you what he looked like, let alone if anyone was after him.
I see...
That must have been hard for you and your mother...being abandoned by him like that.
And at such a young age too.
You must have been very angry with him.
I was.
Hated his guts for it. Still do.
But not enough to kill him if that's what you are implying.
N-No! Of course not. I wasn't implying that at all!
Of course, you are not a suspect!
In that case...it's getting late, and I have more important things to do.
So, if you don't mind?
Oh! No...by all means...
Thank you for coming in, Mr. Bishop.
Please give me a call if anything else comes to mind.
Sure.
(Don't hold your breath, jackass!)
(As you leave his office, you notice an attractive woman waiting outside.)
(Mmm, not bad at all...)
(But what's with the sour face?)
(I would love to try to put a smile on those pretty lips.)
(Unfortunately, I've got other things to worry about right now...)
Back at your apartment...
(What a waste of time.)
(As if I didn't have enough on my mind already.)
(You look at the eviction letter again.)
*Sigh*
(So, they are finally kicking me out of this place?)
(I guess it was going to happen sooner or later.)
(Fuck my life.)
(I just can't seem to catch a break.)
(I need a drink.)
(Well, here's to you, old man...)
(May you rot in hell!)
*Gulp*
*Knock*
(Huh?)
(It seems I can't even get shit-faced in peace.)
*Knock*
Yeah, yeah...calm down.
(You get up and walk towards the door.)
(But as soon as you open it, a giant of a man forces his way in and points a gun at you.)
Whoa! Now don't do any-
Back up.
(I better do as he says.)
(As you step back, he enters your apartment.)
Ruslan wants his money.
(Of course...just what I needed.)
Look, I already told him...I just need a little more time.
Time's up. Either you pay right now...
(He menacingly points his gun at you.)
Or I put a hole in you.
(Little does he know that this is hardly the first time someone has pointed a gun at you.)
(The countless hours of training make your body react almost instinctively.)
(In one fluid motion, you move your head out of the line of fire, firmly grab the gun with your left hand...)
(But fail to disarm the thug.)
Wrong move, asshole!
Wait! Don't-
*BANG*
(And smash the side of your right hand into his wrist to disarm him.)
What the fuck?!
R-Relax, buddy...
I-I'm just following orders!
I wasn't going to shoot you...I swear!
Tell Ruslan he will get his money.
He will just have to be patient a bit longer.
Ruslan is not known for his patience.
I don't give a shit. Now get the fuck out of my apartment!
This isn't over.
Next time he will just send more-
<bounce><b>LEAVE!<b></bounce>
O-Okay!
(He runs out the door.)
(For fuck's sake...)
(This day just keeps getting worse.)
(As if I didn't have enough on my mind already.)
(You drop down onto your couch with a throbbing headache.)
(It seemed like a good idea at the time...)
(Starting your own security firm.)
(A friend hooked you up with Ruslan, a local "investor".)
(I never should have taken his money...)
(But I was so sure my business would be a success.)
(And it was.)
(At first...)
(But then the pandemic hit.)
(Soon, you had to fire your staff and sell off all your equipment.)
(Now, you are out of work...)
(Out of money...)
(And out of options.)
(And you can't help but ask yourself...)
(How am I ever going to get myself out of this mess?)
(You notice that you are still holding the gun in your hand.)
(Heh. That's one way, I guess.)
(But I'm not <b>that</b> desperate...)
(Am I?)
(Then again, it's not like all my problems are going to just magically-)
(Huh? Is that my phone?)
Hello?
Yes.
Uh-huh.
Yes, that's right.
A job interview?
Of course!
That's perfect!
I'll be there.
Great! See you tomorrow.
(Fuck yeah!)
(This might be just the break I was waiting for!)
(Maybe there is still a chance to fix this mess I'm in after all.)
The next morning...
(You arrive at the address you were given, and find yourself in front of a big gate.)
(Wow! This place is huge.)
(These people must be loaded.)
(Let's see if there's an intercom-)
(Before you can finish your thought, the gates swing open.)
(Oh.)
(You pull up their driveway and notice a police car with two cops inside parked out front.)
(Cops, huh?)
(Looks like this place is under surveillance...)
(You get out and walk up to the front door.)
(But before you can ring the bell, a beautiful woman wearing a maid uniform opens the door.)
Mister Bishop?
Yes, that's right. Nice to meet-
Follow me, please.
Oh, okay.
(You follow her into what looks like a study, where she asks you to take a seat.)
Miss Caine will be with you shortly.
Please wait here.
All right. Thank-
(She leaves before you can finish your sentence.)
(Someone got up on the wrong side of bed this morning.)
Half an hour later...
(Miss Caine sure is taking her time...)
(I guess she's a busy woman.)
(I wonder what line of work she's in, this mansion is huge.)
(Let's hope this job pays-)
(The door to the office opens.)
Mister Bishop? 
(Wait, isn't that the woman I saw at the police station yesterday?)
(That can't be a coincidence...)
(You get up from your seat to introduce yourself.)
Yes. It's nice to meet you, Miss-
If you would follow me.
(She makes it sound more like a command than a question.)
Of course.
(You follow her inside her office where you both sit down at her desk.)
My name is Madeline Caine. Thank you for coming, Mister Bishop.
It's my pleasure, Miss Caine. But please, call me [NAME_1].
As you wish.
(You notice she doesn't extend you the same courtesy.)
I'll get straight to the point. My husband was recently murdered.
(She looks at you, waiting for a reaction.)
Please accept my condolences.
(She responds with a hint of coldness in her voice.)
Thank you.
Due to the circumstances surrounding his death, we are currently not allowed to leave the house without a police escort.
(Yeah, that's standard procedure.)
However, our [REL_FAM] highly values privacy, and the constant presence of the police is rather...inconvenient.
Yesterday, while discussing this with Detective Higgins, I expressed that we felt safe within the mansion and don't require protection.
Unfortunately, he was rather insistent.
Even though he doesn't believe we are at risk, it is standard security protocol to be under supervision.
He suggested I hire a private security company if I'm unhappy with the current situation.
(I like where this is going.)
He also asked me why I hadn’t contacted my [REL_SS1] about this. Who, in his words, "is a security specialist, after all".
(Wait! Her [REL_SS1]?!)
Imagine my surprise, when I found out my late husband had a son, whom he neglected to mention in nearly 25 years of marriage!
Hold on a moment! Are you implying that you are...my stepmother?!
(She stares at you blankly.)
That appears to be the case, yes.
(Is she for real?! I guess it’s not a surprise my father remarried...but still, this is not what I was expecting...at all!)
Judging from the expression on your face, you were not aware of our existence either?
No...not at all. I-
Wait? "Our"?
Yes. Your father and I have three [REL_D1+].
Wait! So that means I have...three [REL_S1+]?!
Half-sisters.
(Was that a hint of annoyance in her voice?)
But yes, you do.
I run a highly exclusive mentoring program that teaches young women to become successful in life.
There are currently three girls in this program.
They will be residing here at the mansion for the duration of the program and are under my supervision and care.
(You feel like your whole world has just been turned upside down.)
I understand this is a lot to take in.
(No kidding?!)
However, I would like to offer you a job, nonetheless.
(So much for being welcomed into the [REL_FAM]...)
You would be required to escort the girls to their club practices and accompany me to board meetings.
Other than that you are free to do as you please, so long as you are available when I call on you.
Of course, this also means that you would have to stay at the mansion until this whole thing blows over.
I-I don’t know....I think I need some time to process all of this.
Besides, as a professional bodyguard, it would be unethical to accept a contract protecting a relative or someone with whom I have any personal relationship.
Besides, as a professional bodyguard, it would be unethical to accept a contract protecting someone with a personal relationship to my father.
I understand that. And I appreciate your professionalism.
However, I am sure you can make an exception in this case.
The only reason I want to hire you is to keep Detective Higgins off my back.
It will most likely be the easiest job you have ever had.
(Again, her expression changes, but you can't quite read if it's anger, annoyance or something else.)
I’m sorry. I just don’t think-
I will pay you $100,000. Half up front, half once my husband’s murder investigation is closed.
(Holy crap...$100,000?!)
(That would be more than enough to pay off my debt with Ruslan!)
(Besides, where am I going to stay after I get evicted?)
(This actually works out great!)
(You struggle to keep a straight face.)
That is a...substantial amount of money.
So, do we have an agreement then?
(There is no way I could ever turn down an offer like this.)
(Right?)
We do.
Excellent.
There are some conditions, however...
(And there it is...)
(I knew it sounded too good to be true.)
There is <b>nothing</b> more important to me than the girls.
As you can understand, they are going through a difficult period right now.
(You nod.)
Not being able to leave the mansion only adds to their frustration.
Getting us to our appointments <highlight>on time</highlight> is your priority.
If you fail to do that, I will have no choice but to fire you.
(That goes without saying.)
Of course.
As I mentioned earlier, privacy is of utmost importance to us.
It is also crucial that you respect that and <highlight>refrain from interfering</highlight> in [REL_FM].
Failure to do so will result in immediate termination.
(That's an unusual condition, but I can respect their privacy.)
Understood.
And finally, if you make my girls <highlight>feel uncomfortable</highlight>, in <b>any</b> way, I <b>will</b> fire you without hesitation.
(What?! Now she’s just pushing it...)
(I can’t agree to that, can I?)
(Then again...$100,000 is a <b>lot</b> of money.)
Do you accept these terms?
(It’s not like I have anything to lose...)
(In fact, this may be my only chance to get out of the mess I'm in...)
I do.
Outstanding. I knew we would be able to reach an agreement.
Rebecca!
(The door opens and the woman that let you in earlier, enters the room.)
(Her eyes briefly flicker in your direction.)
Yes, Miss Madeline?
Would you please fetch the girls for me?
Of course, Miss Madeline.
Just so you know, I have already told the girls about you.
(That makes sense.)
(I can imagine it must have been quite a shock to them as well.)
I hope they took the news well?
As well as can be expected.
(I'm not sure what that's supposed to mean.)
(There is a knock at the door.)
Come in.
(Three beautiful young women enter the room.)
Girls, this is [NAME_1]. As I told you earlier, he will be staying with us for a while to ensure our safety.
(Earlier? She must have been very confident I would take the job.)
[NAME_1], this is my youngest [REL_D1], Olivia.
This is Olivia.
Is it really true that you are our [REL_B2]?
It seems so. I’m still processing it myself.
That is SO cool!
I actually have a [REL_B2]!
I can’t wait to get to know you!
(Her excitement is contagious, and you can't help but smile.)
I look forward to that as well, Olivia.
And this is Annabelle, my middle [REL_D1].
This is Annabelle.
*Softly* Uhm, it’s a pleasure to meet you.
(Annabelle's greeting is shy and reserved. She seems hesitant, but there's a glimmer of curiosity in her eyes.)
It's nice to meet you too, Annabelle.
Lastly, this is Victoria, my eldest [REL_D1].
And this is Victoria.
...
Victoria?
Seriously, [REL_M2]? John is killed, and suddenly a stranger shows up claiming to be his son.
(She calls her father by his first name? That's interesting.)
That's enough.
Don’t you think this is all a bit too much of a coincidence?
I said that's enough, Victoria!
But, [REL_M2]...can’t you see he’s just after our money? Please tell me you don’t believe-
But, [REL_M2]...can’t you see he’s just after your money? Please tell me you don’t believe-
(Madeline's hand slams down on her desk, startling everyone in the room.)
<b>Enough</b>!
(The three girls instantly lower their heads and nervously study the floor.)
(Madeline’s voice drops back to her calm, though stern tone and she continues as if nothing happened.)
I know you girls are frustrated with being locked up inside the house and having the cops around all the time.
But now that [NAME_1] is here, the police will leave us alone.
I have also asked him to escort each of you to your weekly club practice.
Ooh! Does that mean I can go to swimming practice again?
Really?! Thanks, [REL_M2]! You’re the best.
*Scoffs*
Is there anything you would like to add, Victoria?
*Softly* No, [REL_M3].
That’s what I thought.
Nevertheless, I will see you downstairs later.
What?! But I-
Do I make myself clear?
*Softly* Yes, [REL_M3].
(She seems to be <b>very</b> strict with her [REL_D1+].)
(And what exactly is "downstairs"?)
That will be all, girls. Off you go.
(As the girls leave the office, Rebecca re-enters.)
Rebecca, please show [NAME_1] to his room, and explain the details of the job to him.
Yes, Miss Madeline.
Please follow me, Sir.
Thank you.
A bit later...
This will be your room.
You are free to use any of the facilities. But only when Miss Caine and the girls are not using them, of course.
Sure, no problem.
You are free to help yourself to breakfast, lunch, and dinner in the kitchen.
Miss Caine and the girls will have their dinner in the dining room and are not to be disturbed.
(What, I'm not even allowed to join them for dinner?!)
(Why do I get the feeling that Madeline doesn't want me to get to know my [REL_S1+] at all?)
(Maybe she was just saying that so I would take the job?)
Please use the rest of the day to pick up your belongings and take care of any unfinished business you may have.
Starting tomorrow, Miss Caine expects you be available whenever she calls.
Understood.
Your first payment will be transferred to you tomorrow.
(Ka-ching!)
I have sent Miss Caine’s and the girls’ schedules to your phone. Make sure they arrive at their appointments on time and that you treat them with the utmost respect.
Of course.
(She suddenly gets very fierce.)
No!
That will <b>not</b> do!
I beg your pardon?
You should be grateful that Miss Caine would even offer the likes of you an opportunity to work for this [REL_FAM]!
The likes of me?! What is that supposed to-
(She cuts you off again.)
So, while you stay under their roof, you <b>will</b> treat them with respect.
Is that clear?
(I better take a deep breath.)
(I'll give her a piece of my mind.)
Look, I can see that you are very committed to this [REL_FAM], and I can assure you that I am a professional, just like you.
...
I will make sure to always treat them with the proper respect.
We will see about that.
(She leaves the room.)
(What is her problem?)
(At least I managed to calm her down a bit.)
Now listen here, little lady...
*Gasps*
This isn’t my first job. I’m a professional.
So I suggest you take it down a notch.
*Scoffs* We'll see about that!
(She storms out of the room.)
(What is her problem?)
(I better stay on my guard around her.)
(Anyway, let's go pick up my stuff at my apartment.)
(Let's go to my apartment first, by selecting it on the city tab on the map.)
(Well, here we are.)
*Scoffs*
(“Home sweet home”.)
(The sooner I gather my things, the sooner I’m out of here.)
(But it shouldn't take me long...most of this stuff isn’t even mine anyway.)
(Not that I would want any of this junk...)
(“Fully furnished” my ass.)
(Anyway, I’ll just grab my clothes and the few personal belongings I have left, so I can leave this place once and for all.)
Several hours later...
(Well, that’s all I’ve got.)
(Damn! That took me way longer than I thought!)
(Anyway, let’s head back to the mansion.)
(Ooh, I like the sound of that!)
(Who would have thought that I’d be trading in this cramped little apartment for a fancy-ass mansion?)
(I guess good things do come to those who wait...hehe!)
(Let's go back to the mansion.)
(I don't see any reason to go back there.)
(My alarm is going off.)
(Victoria's boxing lesson starts at 19:30.)
(I better go pick her up, before she's late!)
(I really need some coffee right now.)
(Let's use the map to go to the kitchen.)
(I should wait here until Madeline returns.)
[NAME_1], a moment please?
(Huh, Rebecca? I wonder what she wants with me.)
What's up?
Miss Caine has asked me to invite you to join her and the girls for dinner.
Oh?! That's...unexpected.
(She stares at you blankly.)
Yes...quite so.
Now, if you'll excuse me, I need to prepare dinner.
(It seems Madeline is finally warming up to me...)
(It would probably be smart to accept her invitation.)
(All right. Rebecca has gone home.)
(Time to find out what's behind that metal door.)
A few minutes later...
(Well, here I go.)
(Hmm, the corridor seems to split at the end.)
(But there are also corridors to my left and right.)
(You turn to your right.)
(Huh? A ladder?!)
(You turn to the other side.)
(There's another one over there...)
(What the hell is this place?!)
(Let's start with that one and see where it leads...)
(As you get closer to the ladder, you notice a hole in the wall.)
(Huh? What's that?)
(You try to look through it.)
(This is the backside of an air vent!)
(It's too dark to see through it...)
(But that must be the storage room Rebecca was talking about!)
(Hmm...that's an odd place for an air vent.)
(I wonder...)
(Let's explore a bit further.)
(You climb up the ladder.)
(This ladder seems to go all the way up to the second floor.)
(Huh? That's weird...)
(It seems to be a dead end.)
(But there are two more air vents...)
(Let's see...)
(It's the laundry room!)
(Then the other side must be...)
(Victoria's bedroom!)
(No way!)
(Does that mean that the other corridors all lead to different rooms in the mansion?)
(Hmm, Victoria's not in her room right now.)
(She's probably taking her evening bath.)
(...)
(Well, I'll have to find out if my theory about these corridors is correct at some point...)
(You climb back downstairs...)
(And head back to the entrance.)
(So that would mean I have to take a left at the back of this corridor, to get to the bathroom?)
(You walk to the end of the corridor...)
(And turn to the left.)
(Another ladder!)
(Let's see where this takes me...)
(Two more air vents!)
(So that means the bathroom would have to be to the left...)
(Yes! I was right!)
(There are spyholes all over the-)
(Oh! Hello...)
(Damn...)
(So this is how the blackmailer knew what I was doing?)
(I can't believe I was being watched all this time...)
(That means it has to be someone that knows about-)
(Oh! She's getting out of the bath...)
(Wow!)
(You have unlocked Victoria's naked paperdoll animation.)
(I know I shouldn't be spying on her, but-)
(She leans over the bath to take out the stopper.)
(-how can I not look at a body like that?!)
(Seriously?!)
(Look at that beautiful ass...)
*Grunts*
(Oh, man...She's killing me right now.)
*Grunts*
Got you!
(She gets back up.)
(As she moves to the other side of the bathroom, you lose sight of her.)
(Right.)
(I better get out of here...)
(I need some time to think.)
A few minutes later...
(Well, that was...unexpected.)
(Your eyes are drawn to the air vent.)
(The blackmailer has probably been spying on me ever since I got here...)
(Hmm, who else could know about the hidden corridors?)
(Think, [NAME_1]!)
(Let's see...)
(The numpad in the utility closet looked old...)
(But Madeline told me they moved here recently...)
(So it's safe to assume that these corridors were put in by a previous owner.)
(She also mentioned that my dad was the one who bought the house...)
(In which case, the seller would have most likely informed him about the hidden corridors.)
(And one of the keys was missing from the hidden compartment in the bookshelf...)
(So that adds up...)
(Although it doesn't explain how the blackmailer got the key from my dad...)
(Unless...)
(The seller didn't tell my dad about the hidden corridors, for some reason...)
(Maybe they didn't know about them either?)
(But instead...)
(One of the girls found out about it just like I did?)
(Which would not just explain the missing key, but the spying as well!)
(That would fit perfectly!)
(Hmm...)
(Things are finally falling into place...)
(Perhaps I'll by able to find out more, by doing a little spying myself...)
(Or maybe, if I time it right, I can catch the blackmailer in the act, when they are coming out of the utlity closet!)
(One thing is for sure...)
(I'm finally getting closer to finding out who has been blackmailing me.)
(And when I do...)
(I'll make them pay for messing with me.)
(But first...)
*Yawn*
(I need some sleep.)
The next morning...
*Yawn*
(Ahh...I needed that!)
(So, what should I do today?)
(Hmm, maybe I can investigate the hidden corridors a bit more?)
(Let's have a look at the map first.)
(Let's have a look at the mansion map first.)
*Bzzzt*
(What's this?)
(Yes! The money has been transferred to my account!)
(With this, I can pay off my debt to Ruslan and even have some left to spare!)
(I should go and see him, so I can put this mess behind me.)
(I should visit Ruslan first.)
(I can't afford that.)
(I already bought that.)
(The mall is closed right now.)
(I should visit between 8:00 and 18:00.)
(Quit playing?)
Yes.
No.
*Yawn*
(Ugh...I'm exhausted.)
(Let's log off for now.)
(Damn! I didn't know these games could be so addictive...)
(I don't see any reason to buy that.)
(At least not right now...)
(It's closed during the weekend.)
(I should go there on a week day.)
(The girls are having dinner.)
We are having dinner, [NAME_1].
(Her tone implies that you are not welcome here.)
Oh, right...sorry, Miss Caine.
What did I just tell you?!
Don't make me repeat myself!
(Oh, crap! What was I thinking?!)
My apologies, Miss Caine.
Are you kidding me?!
My office, now!
Ah, [NAME_1]! Would you like to join us?
(Should I have dinner with the girls?)
I would love to.
Maybe some other time.
*Loud* Rebecca, could you bring one more plate, please?
You take your place at the dinner table...
*Gasp* Oh my God, that cat video you showed me was so funny!
I must have watched it like a zillion times.
I take it you had already finished your homework then?
Uhm, well…
Now what did I tell you about getting distracted?
(What should I do?)
Stick up for her.
Keep quiet.
Actually, that’s my fault.
I shouldn't have shown it to her while she was doing her homework, I'm sorry.
I…see.
Still, Olivia should know better. Shouldn’t you?
 Yes, [REL_M3].
(She glances over at you and smiles.)
I'm sorry.
I will see you downstairs tonight.
But [REL_M2], I-
(She gives Olivia a sharp look.)
*Softly* Yes, [REL_M3]...
(Hmm, again with the downstairs...)
(I wonder what goes on down there...)
(Hmm, again with the mysterious "downstairs"...)
(Maybe I could try using the hidden tunnel to spy on them tonight?)
(TODO)
(TODO)
So, did you do your workout today, Annabelle?
(She glances over at you.)
Yes, I did.
Good.
I know it's not your favorite thing, sweetheart, but it’s important to stay fit.
Especially with all that time you spend behind your computer.
I know, [REL_M2]...
Oh! [NAME_1] told me he has a background in personal training!
Wow! That’s so cool, [NAME_1]!
Maybe he could help you with your workout?
*Gasp* Oh, no! He doesn’t have to do-
Would you mind, [NAME_1]?
Not at all. I would be happy to help.
I-I really don't think-
Great! Then it’s settled.
Oh my God! You are SO lucky, Annie!
Having [NAME_1] as your own personal trainer!
Aren't you excited?
W-What...excited?! N-No!
(She looks at you again.)
(And blushes furiously.)
I-I mean...I do...appreciate the offer...I just-
*Softly* Thanks, [NAME_1]...
*Giggles*
Thank you for inviting me to dinner, Miss Caine.
You are welcome.
(She pauses, as if weighing her next words carefully.)
Since you're living with us now, I thought it would be appropriate for you to join us for dinner.
(That’s not what Rebecca told me.)
(But of course, I’m not going to bring that up.)
I appreciate that.
(You finish the rest of the meal in awkward silence.)
So Annabelle, how was your workout with [NAME_1] today?
(She glances at you nervously.)
Oh, uhm...it went well.
(Huh? Why is she lying?)
(Madeline's eyes narrow...)
(And she looks over at you.)
Is that right, [NAME_1]?
(Damn it, why did Annabelle put me on the spot like this.)
(Is she testing me?)
(Maybe she wants to find out if I'll cover for her?)
(Then again, Madeline seems to be on to her...)
(What should I do?)
(Cover for her.)
(Tell the truth.)
Actually...
(You look over to Annabelle apologetically.)
We decided to skip our workout today, because Annabelle was feeling a bit sore.
Is that so?
(She stares coldly at Annabelle.)
I will see you downstairs, tonight.
*Softly* Yes, [REL_M3].
(Hmm...)
(That should be interesting...)
(You feel sorry for snitching on her...)
(But you can't deny that the thought of spying on them excites you.)
Yes, we had a great workout.
Annabelle is making great progress.
Excellent!
Keep up the good work, you two.
(Annabelle glances at you and smiles.)
(You smile back and wink at her.)
After dinner...
(Ahh, that was delicious!)
(So, what's next?)
As you wish.
(You already told Madeline you won't be joining them today.)
*Bzzzt*
(A message?)
(Let's see...)
Let's play a game.
(Huh?)
(It's from an unknown number...)
Who is this?
And how did you get this number?
Now where would the fun be in me telling you that?
(Screw that.)
I don’t have time for games.
Oh, I’m sure you’re very busy.
Keeping those pretty girls safe from harm...
(What the hell?!)
You weren’t too busy to receive a visitor last night, though. Were you?
(You feel a shiver running down your spine.)
Who the fuck is this?!
I wonder how your employer would feel about that.
(All right, [NAME_1]. Stay cool.)
(First, let's find out how much they know.)
(You take a deep breath.)
How they would feel about what, exactly?
Don’t play dumb with me.
About you fucking that pretty little maid, of course. 
On your first day, no less.
(Shit! How do they even know about that?!)
(Did Rebecca tell someone?)
(Or did someone see her going into my room?)
(Come to think of it, she did act weird when I tried to talk to her in the kitchen...)
(Could she be in on this?)
(Or is she being blackmailed as well?!)
(Fuck! Why couldn't I just keep my dick in my pants?)
I don’t know what you’re talking about.
Then you don’t value your job very much.
Or hers, for that matter.
(Shit! That's right. It won't be just my job that's on the line...)
(But they can't do anything without proof.)
What makes you think that my employer will believe you?
Do you have any evidence of these false accusations?
False accusations?
I'm sure you think you're very clever.
But we both know there is nothing false about them, don't we?
And whether or not I have evidence...
If you don't do as I say, you will find out soon enough.
(Fuck!)
(I can’t lose this job!)
(I guess I have no choice.)
What do you want from me?
I already told you.
And I hate repeating myself.
Really? You want to play a game?
Good boy.
Allow me to explain the rules to you.
I will give you a task and you will perform it. 
Simple, isn’t it?
(I need to find out who this piece of shit is.)
(But until I do, I better play along.)
Depends on the task.
Then let’s start with something simple…
You will expose yourself to the youngest [REL_D1].
(What the fuck?!)
You want me to take my junk out in front of her?!
Are you for real?!
That will definitely get me fired!
Not my problem.
You figure it out.
Once you have completed your task, I will be in contact.
(Huh?)
And how would you even know?
(...)
(No answer.)
(Fuck! This is bad!)
(Who could this be?)
(And why would they want me to expose myself to Olivia?)
(To get me fired?)
(That just doesn't make sense!)
(If that's the case, why bother blackmailing me?)
(They could just tell Madeline about me and Rebecca.)
(Unless...they don’t really have any proof at all...)
(Of course!)
(They could be bluffing...)
(But that's not a risk I'm willing to take.)
(Not yet, anyway.)
(If I’m wrong, I’ll lose my job.)
(And that can't happen under <b>any</b> circumstances.)
(I'll have to get more information somehow.)
(Besides, they could have an ulterior motive.)
*Sigh*
(I guess I'll have to figure out a way to expose myself to Olivia...)
(But I'll have to make it look like an accident.)
(I believe she takes a bath every evening...)
(If I time it right, I might be able to get her to walk in on me.)
(Oh, man. This is so wrong.)
(Let's just hope I can put a stop to this before it gets out of hand...)
*Bzzzt*
(Another message.)
(It's from an unknown number again...)
You have completed your first task.
Well done.
(The only one who knows that is Olivia...)
(So it has to be-)
(...)
(Of course!)
(The phone call I overheard...)
(Could the person she was talking to be the blackmailer?)
(Or...are they in on this together?)
It seems you are ready for something a bit more challenging.
(Great...)
How long are we going to keep doing this?
As long as I say we are.
(Not if I can help it.)
Now, for your next task...
This time you will expose yourself to the middle [REL_D1]…
What?! Not again?!
…while having an erection.
(You gotta be kidding me!)
Come on! You know I can’t do that!
It’s a miracle I got away with it the first time!
Stop. Talking.
Don’t make me lose my patience.
I don’t care how you do it. Figure it out...
Or lose your job.
I will be watching.
(For fuck's sake!)
(There's no way I can pull that off without getting in trouble.)
(But if I don't do it...I'll lose my job for sure.)
(If they aren't bluffing, that is...)
(But there's no way to tell...not yet anyway.)
(Fuck!)
(I guess have no choice but to play along again...)
*Sigh*
(So this time Annabelle is the target?)
(That's...unexpected.)
(What would Olivia gain from me exposing myself to Annabelle?)
(It just doesn't make sense...)
(Maybe I'm missing something?)
(Either way, I'll have to come up with a new plan...)
(I guess I could try the same tactics I used with Olivia.)
(After all, it worked the first time.)
(Annabelle takes her showers in the morning.)
(So I guess I know what to do...)
(Hmm, I half expected another message from the blackmailer…)
(Maybe they've grown tired of our little game?)
(Let's hope so...)
(Anyway, time for bed!)
Later that night...
*Bzzzt*
(Huh?)
*Yawn*
(Of course…)
(I just <b>had</b> to jinx it.)
(Let's see what they want now...)
VICTORIA'S ROOM! NOW!
(Huh?)
HURRY!
What, no sweet-talking this time?
NO TIME!
GO!
NOW!
(What the hell?!)
(If I didn’t know any better, I’d think something was wrong…)
(Wait…)
(Could Victoria be in danger?!)
(Your heart starts racing.)
(Fuck!)
(You jump out of bed and run into the hallway.)
Meanwhile in Victoria's bedroom...
*Bzzzt*
(Here we go again...)
Three tasks already.
You're on a roll.
What do you want this time?
Oh?
Someone's grumpy...
*Sigh*
Just get on with it already.
All right, if you're so eager to play...
I think [REL_M2] is feeling a bit left out.
(For fuck's sake.)
Don't worry, I'll go easy on you.
All you have to do is...
Grab her ass.
(Of course...)
In that case, I might as well quit my job right now.
Aw. Don't give up so easily.
Who knows? She might even like it...
Yeah, right.
That's never going to happen.
You might be surprised...
(Huh? What do they mean by that?)
Why are you even doing this?
What's in it for you?
(No answer...as usual.)
(I guess it's time to get creative again...)
-shoot!
(Huh?)
(...)
(W-Where am I?)
(Wait, is this-)
(Am I...)
(...dead?)
Game over
(Tsk...)
(That's what you get, for not doing as I tell you!)
(Why do I even bother explaining these things?)
(Seriously, do you want this game to end before it has even started?)
(All you had to do was <highlight>move the mouse in a clockwise circle</highlight>!)
(*Sigh*.)
(Fine.)
(I guess I can give you another chance.)
(But don't screw it up this time!)
A few minutes later...
<bounce><b>YOU ARE FIRED!</b></bounce>
Now get the <b>HELL</b> out of my house!
Game over
(Seriously?! I <b>just</b> told you, <highlight>your actions will have consequences</highlight>!)
(And yet, the first thing you do is grab that poor girl's ass?!)
(Maybe you should try showing her some affection first?)
(You know? Build up an actual relationship with her, and all that?)
(*Sigh*)
(Let's try that again...)
A few minutes later...
I can't believe you fail to do even one simple task!
<bounce><b>You are fired!</b></bounce>
Game over
(She told you your priority was to get them to their appointments <highlight>on time</highlight>!)
(How did you manage to screw up something so simple?!)
(I guess I can give you another shot...)
(Try not to mess up this time, okay?)
A few minutes later...
I am done with you!
<bounce><b>You are fired!</b></bounce>
Game over
(You don't know when to take a hint do you?)
(Try again, if you like...)
(Although I'm starting to think it won't make much of a difference...)
Back at the mansion...
You call yourself a bodyguard?!
You can't even protect yourself!
<bounce><b>YOU ARE FIRED!</b></bounce>
Now get the <b>HELL</b> out of my house!
Game over
(Oof...)
(Maybe you shouldn't get into fights you can't win.)
(*Sigh*)
(I guess you want another chance, don't you?)
(Try not blocking those punches with your face this time, okay?)
Even though Olivia is still young, she can be very persuasive. She makes sure she <i>always</i> gets what she wants.
expensive things
watching tv
fashion
social media
homework
not getting her way
Swimming practice (10:30 - 12:30)
She likes to watch TV in the living room in the evening.
She takes her baths in the evening. If I time it right, I might be able to get her to walk in on me.
In the evening, she's usually talking on the phone in her room.
I need to take her to her swimming practice on Wednesday at 10:00.
I need to take her to her swimming practice again, on Wednesday at 10:00.
Maybe I should cover for her at dinner?
Let's watch some TV with her again.
I should snoop around in her bedroom, when she is taking her evening bath.
I guess I'll just to have to wait until she finishes reading that book.
I could spy on her when she takes her evening bath.
I could distract her while she is doing her homework.
Maybe I shouldn't stick up for her during dinner.
I should spy on her and Madeline at midnight.
I think I just need a good night's sleep.
I should take her to swimming practice again.
I could distract her while she is doing her homework again.
I should pick her up for the swimming contest on Saturday at 10:00.
I'm sure something will happen eventually.
Best boyfriend ever
Win the swimming contest.
I'm so glad I have a [REL_B1]!
I can't wait to get to know him better.
He seems like a really cool guy.
He's kinda hot...
I hope I'll find a boyfriend like him one day.
I wonder if he's attracted to me too?
I think I love him.
He's the best [REL_B1] in the world!
I think I'm in love with him!
I can't stop thinking about him...
I'll do <highlight>ANYTHING</highlight> to make him happy!
(All right, that's all of it.)
(I guess I'm really doing this...)
(Time for a new chapter in my life!)
(Hmm, I just realized I will be living here with all these women.)
(I guess that makes me...)
(The Man of the House!)
*Crickets*
(Erm...)
(Sorry. I don't know where that came-)
(Suddenly, you hear someone sneaking up behind you.)
(Judging from the sound of the footsteps, not to mention the hysterical giggling, you instantly know it's Olivia.)
*Giggles* Guess who?
*Gasp* Oh no! Who could it be?
Is it...Annabelle?
Wrong!
Uhm...Victoria?
Wrong again!
Wait...don't tell me it's...Miss Caine?
Haha! Wrong, silly!
Hmm, I don't think I've met anyone else...
Of course you did!
Did I? Mmm...
I don't recall-
Oh, right! I'm so dumb!
Rebecca!
Haha! As if!
Aren't you forgetting like the <b>most</b> important person?
I don't think so.
I don't remember anyone else living here.
Think harder!
I'm afraid you'll have to give me a hint.
Haha! Okay...
She's only the sweetest girl you've ever met!
No, that doesn't ring a bell...
And the cutest one too!
Hmm, I don't recall meeting someone like that...
Haha! What about the [REL_S2] you always dreamed of?
Oh! Could it be...Olivia?
Yay! Finally!
(She removes her hands and you turn around.)
(She is wearing some rather skimpy pyjamas...)
(And you can't help but notice her beautiful figure.)
(Wow! Such a tight little body.)
(And she's got a great pair of-)
(...)
(Fuck! What am I thinking?)
(I just found out this girl is my [REL_S2]!)
(Not to mention, a client as well.)
(I shouldn't be looking at her like that.)
(Get your head back in the game, [NAME_1]!)
(I guess that's what I get for neglecting my sex life for so long.)
(I better do something about that...)
(I can't have these hormones messing with my head...)
(Especially not while I'm on the job.)
(Note to self: Get laid.)
Helloooo? Earth to [NAME_1]...
Are you spacing out?
Or were you just admiring my awesome pyjamas?
Oh...uhm, yeah.
Actually, I was. 
And you're right, they are pretty awesome!
I know, right?
Don't they look super cute on me?
Totally! They look <b>super</b> cute on you!
Haha! Thanks!
(Hot damn!)
(That is some view-)
(No! Focus, [NAME_1]!)
Anyway, I thought I'd stop by to welcome you.
(That's nice of her.)
(I guess at least someone is happy that I'm here.)
And I know [REL_M2] and my [REL_S2+] might seem a bit...unfriendly...
But I'm sure they'll come around once they get to know you a bit.
Thanks, Olivia. I appreciate it.
You're welcome.
...
(She suddenly walks up to you and wraps her arms around you.)
I'm really glad you're here.
(You feel her big breasts pressing against you, as she hugs you tightly.)
Uhm...
(What should I do?)
(Hug her back.)
(Grab that cute little ass.)
(You wrap your arms around her and hold her tightly.)
I'm glad to be here too.
...
(Wait. Is she...feeling my muscles?)
...
(Yeah, she definitely is.)
...
*Gasp*
(Suddenly aware of what she is doing, she quickly lets go and steps back.)
Oh! Uhm, well...I won't keep you up any longer. I'm sure you're tired.
Bye!
Good night, Olivia.
(As she leaves the room, you notice she is blushing furiously.)
(Haha! That's cute.)
(You can't help yourself from checking out her ass.)
(Fuck me!)
(That is one cute little butt.)
*Sigh*
(I know she's my [REL_S2]...)
(But this is going to be a real challenge.)
(Anyway, I better get some sleep.)
(I'm starting my new job tomorrow, and I need to be sharp.)
(Oh! That's right! A new job!)
(I finally have a job again!)
(And I'll have enough money to pay off Ruslan!)
(I can't believe things are finally looking up again!)
(It seems like my troubles are finally over!)
(If you only knew what you were getting yourself into...)
(You can't control yourself and decide to cop a feel.)
(Damn! She's got such a firm little ass.)
*Gasp* What the hell?! Pervert!
<bounce><b>[REL_M2]!</bounce></b>
The next morning...
(Olivia should be here for her evening bath soon.)
(I guess I’ll just take a quick shower and wait for her to show up.)
A bit later...
*Sigh* Aaah...
(Nothing like a hot shower...)
(Olivia should-)
(You hear footsteps approaching.)
(Oh, shit! That's probably her!)
(You quickly put the towel over your head to make it look like you’re drying yourself off.)
(I hope this will work...)
(As you hear the door open, you feel your heart racing in your chest.)
(But what if it's not her?!)
(I didn't even consider someone else might come in and see me like this...)
*Gasp*
(But the sound of Olivia’s voice quickly reassures you.)
[NAME_1]?!
(Well, here goes nothing...)
Olivia?! Can’t you knock?!
Me?! 
Why didn’t <i>you</i> lock the door?!
You are…
(She glances down at your exposed body.)
Completely naked...
(Her face turns crimson red.)
I’m used to living on my own...I never lock the door!
Well, you should.
I can see your...
(Her eyes drift downwards again.)
*Softly* Thing...
*Clears throat* Do you mind?
S-Sorry!
(She's blushing even more furiously now.)
(Coming to her senses, she quickly shuts the bathroom door.)
(...)
(Well, I guess that went pretty well...all things considered.)
(Although, I do feel a bit bad for making her feel like it was her fault.)
(But it's not like I had much of a choice.)
(I wonder if the blackmailer will really find out. There's no way-)
(And suddenly it hits you.)
(Wait!)
(If they do, it can only mean two things...)
(Either I'm being watched...)
(Or Olivia is...the blackmailer?!)
(Come to think of it, her room is right next to mine...)
(She could have spotted Rebecca going into my room!)
(But why would she threaten to fire me?)
(She's the only one that genuinely seems happy I'm here...)
(I can't imagine that she wants to get rid of me.)
(Unless she doesn't want me to get fired at all...)
(Maybe she just wants to have some fun with me?)
(Could it be that she's just playing a prank on her [REL_B2]?)
(If that's true, she's taking this a bit far though.)
(But at least it wouldn't be as bad as the alternative...)
(I'll have to keep a close eye on her.)
(Anyway, mission completed. Let's get out of here.)
(You put your clothes back on and leave the bathroom.)
(As you walk past Olivia's bedroom, you overhear her talking on the phone...)
...completely naked!
(Huh?)
I'm not! I swear!
...
Haha, no! He just left the door open.
(She's talking about me!)
Well, he's used to living on his own, so I guess he forgot to lock it.
...
Haha! Of course not!
You are so bad!
...
Yeah, definitely!
And you should have seen his abs!
Yeah, it was <i>so</i> hot!
(Oh? I guess I am still in pretty good shape after all...)
Yeah, for real!
And that's not even the best part!
I even saw his-
Huh?
One sec.
Hello? Is anyone there?
Hang on. I need to close the door.
(I better get out of here.)
(Olivia is having breakfast with Madeline.)
Hey, Olivia.
Oh. Good morning, [NAME_1].
(She appears somewhat reserved.)
So, how's my favorite [REL_S2] doing?
(She nervously glances at Madeline.)
I'm fine, thank you.
(Hmm, she seems a bit on edge with Madeline here.)
Right. Well, enjoy your day.
Thanks. You too.
Good morning, [NAME_1].
(Let's just leave her alone for now.)
(Olivia is brushing her hair.)
Hey, Olivia.
Oh. Hey, [NAME_1].
What's up?
(Olivia is doing her laps.)
(I shouldn't distract her right now.)
(You approach the pool.)
(As soon as Olivia sees you, she gets out.)
(That bikini looks great on her...)
Hey, [NAME_1]!
(You force yourself not to stare.)
Hey.
What's up?
(Olivia is having lunch.)
Oh! Hey, [NAME_1]!
What's up?
(Olivia seems to be focused on her studies.)
(I shouldn't distract her.)
(Olivia is doing her homework.)
Hey, Olivia.
Oh. Hey, [NAME_1]...
Sorry, but I'm kinda busy at the moment...
I have to finish my stupid homework.
In that case, I won't distract you any longer.
Too bad. I have this really cool video I wanted to show you.
Thanks...I guess.
Ooh!
But since you're busy, I guess it will have to wait-
No-no! I have time for one video!
Many videos later...
Oh my God! That's hilarious!
I know, right?
And did you see this one-
*Gasp* Oh, crap!
I totally lost track of time!
It's dinner time already!
I better hurry or my [REL_M2] will be pissed!
(She dashes out of her room and runs downstairs.)
Sorry, but I really should focus on my homework right now...
Oh. No problem.
I'll leave you to it then.
Thanks.
(That's unlike her...)
(Maybe that spanking Madeline gave her scared her straight, after all?)
(I already talked to her.)
(As soon as Olivia sees you, her face lights up.)
Oh! Hey, [NAME_1]!
Do you want to watch some TV together?
Sure.
Maybe some other time.
Cool!
After a while...
I need to use the bathroom.
I'm just gonna pause it real quick.
Can I get you anything?
Maybe a cold beer?
That sounds tempting, but I don't drink while I'm on the job.
What job? We're just hanging out and watching some TV together...
You do know it's important to unwind a little every now and then, don't you?
(I guess she has a point.)
(Besides, one beer won't hurt.)
What the hell! Why not?
Cool. I'll be right back.
(As she gets up and walks to the kitchen...)
(Your eyes are drawn to her ass.)
(I know I'm not supposed to be looking at her like this...)
(But it's hard not to, when she keeps wearing these skimpy outfits.)
...
A few minutes later...
Here you go. One nice, cold beer!
Thanks, Olivia!
I'll just put it down there...
Enjoy!
(Come on! Don't bend over in front of me like that...)
(I'm starting to think she's doing it on purpose...)
After watching tv for while...
That was fun! Thanks for joining me.
No problem, I had a good time.
And thanks for the beer.
My pleasure!
So, uhm...I guess it's good night then.
Yeah, good night.
Go ahead and make yourself comfortable...
I’ll be right back.
Okay.
A few minutes later...
(As before, she returns with a beer...)
(But instead of putting it on the table, she casually sits down on your lap.)
Uh, Olivia, what are you-?
(She takes a sip.)
Ah…
Perfect!
A cold beer for my hot boyfriend.
*Giggles*
(Huh?! Why is she still acting like-)
(She interrupts your thoughts with a kiss...)
(And for a moment her soft lips make you forget what you were thinking.)
*Soft moan*
(Wait! What am I doing?!)
Olivia, stop! You really shouldn’t be doing that...
Relax, [NAME_1]...
It’s just a sip of beer.
What?! No, I mean- 
Fine! Here...
Let’s just watch TV...
(She snuggles closer, making herself comfortable on your lap.)
Why don't you sit...over there, on the other couch?
Because...
I want to cuddle...
(She looks at you and pouts.)
Don’t you want to cuddle with me, [NAME_1]?
(Her seductive tone evokes a stir of feelings within you.) 
(Feelings you know you shouldn’t entertain...)
Listen, Olivia-
Please…just for a little while?
(Oh, man…she's really making me hard on this-)
(I mean...making this hard on me!)
I’ll let you borrow my laptop.
What?!
My laptop...
You said you needed it, right?
Well, yeah…but-
I’ll leave it on the desk in your bedroom.
Okay?
(She looks at you again you with innocent eyes.)
(I know she's manipulating me...)
(But I do want that laptop…)
(And I can’t deny it feels good having her this close to me...)
(Besides, what’s the big deal anyway?)
(She’s just sitting on my lap…)
(I just have to be careful no one sees us...)
Fine, just for a little while then.
Yay! 
But if someone comes in, you need to get off right away!
I will, I promise!
After a while...
That was nice.
Thanks for letting me cuddle with you…
Anyway, I’ll go get my laptop!
Oh, right...thanks.
(I can't help feeling a bit...cheap.)
Good night, [NAME_1]!
Yeah, good night.
(I’m going to have to be more careful with her...)
(She's not as innocent as she looks...)
Later...
That was fun, [NAME_1]!
Have a good night!
You too, Olivia.
Oh...
Okay.
See you later then...
(She seems disappointed.)
(I'll just leave her alone for now.)
(No way!)
(The final book!)
(You walk over to her bed.)
(Yes! With this I can finally find out what that contraption in the bookshelf does.)
(But I can’t just take it...)
(Can I?)
(Before you can make a decision, the bedroom door opens…)
[NAME_1]?! What are you doing in here?
(She closes the door behind her as she enters the room.)
Oh, Olivia! I uhm…
(Come on, think of something!)
I...wanted to ask if you wanted to watch a movie together.
(She looks at you suspiciously.)
But why did you close the door if you knew I wasn’t in here?
Uhm…because…
(How do I talk my way out of this?)
I…was-
(Her expression suddenly changes.)
Planning on hiding in here?
Huh?!
Peeping on me as I got dressed?
What?! No! 
Hoping to catch a glimpse of my naked body?
Of course not! I would never-
You know…
You could have just asked…
(She starts removing her towel.)
(No way! Is she really going to-)
*Laughs* Oh my God! 
Relax, [NAME_1]!
I’m just messing with you!
(You can’t help but feel a little disappointed.)
 Of course! I knew that...
But you almost got me!
Almost?! Please…I totally got you!
You should have seen the look on your face!
Whatever.
*Giggles* You are kinda cute when you get all shy like this.
Ugh. I’m out of here.
Aren’t you forgetting something?
Huh?
The movie?
Oh…right.
Of course, I want to watch it with you!
I’ll be downstairs in a few minutes.
Okay.
(I guess there are worse ways to spend the evening.)
A few hours later...
I loved that!
Thanks for inviting me.
No problem.
Well, good night then.
Yeah, good-
(The book!)
Oh, before I forget!
I noticed a book on your bed…
You mean when you were snooping around my room?
Yeah, yeah.
*Giggles*
I was wondering if I could borrow it from you.
What do you want with that old book?
Oh, just…curious, that’s all.
Is that so?
...
Well, I guess you can have it…
(Yes!)
After I finish reading it.
(Don't tell me she's planning on reading that?!)
But I have to warn you...I am a veeeery slow reader.
Oh really? How slow are we talking here?
Oh, I don’t know…a book like that?
A couple of months?
What?! That long?!
Maybe longer…
(Oh, I see what she’s doing.)
Let me guess…
You want something in return?
(She looks at you innocently.)
Now what makes you say that?
*Sigh* What’s it going to be this time?
Hmm...I’ll have to think about it.
But I’ll let you know as soon as I have decided.
Of course you will…
*Giggles* Good night, [NAME_1]!
Good night, Olivia.
(Frustrating as it is to be this close to solving the puzzle…)
(You can’t help but smile to yourself.)
(That girl really is a handful.)
Later that night...
*Zzz*
(You wake up to the sound of your bedroom door opening.)
Huh...Olivia?
Hey, [NAME_1].
Is something wrong?
No…I just…uhm…
I've finished reading that book you wanted to borrow…
So I thought I’d bring it over.
(In the middle of the night?!)
Thanks, but...couldn’t it wait until tomorrow?
Actually…there’s something I wanted to ask you as well.
(What a surprise...)
And what would that be?
Remember how you said I could ask for anything in return for the book?
(She has an interesting way of remembering things...)
Well, I have a favor to ask you...
(Here it comes...)
Could I…uhm…stay with you tonight?
What?! Of course not!
Why would you even ask that?!
(Her expression turns sad and it looks like she’s holding back tears.)
It's just that..I’ve been having so much trouble sleeping ever since…you know…
That thing with [REL_F2] happened...
(Oh...crap!)
I just feel so scared when I'm alone in my bed at night.
(I hadn't even thought of that…now I feel like an ass.)
Nothing bad will happen to you, Olivia.
I will keep you safe, I promise.
I know you will…
That’s why I want to stay with you.
Can I, please?
I promise I'll be good!
(I can’t deny it would feel good to have someone next to me in bed again…)
(But if Madeline finds out, I can kiss my job goodbye.)
I'm sorry, Olivia...but we can’t.
If [REL_M4] finds out-
She won’t! I promise!
(For a short moment her innocent demeanor changes.)
Besides, don’t you think she’d be far more upset if she found out we kissed?
(The hair on the back of your neck stands up.)
And how would she find out about that, exactly?
She won’t!
Just like she won’t find out about me staying with you tonight.
(She closes the door and walks up to your bed.)
Olivia, I didn’t say-
Here’s the book.
(It's hard to keep my eyes off those perky tits...) 
(She is doing it again...)
(Trying to manipulate me.)
(But I’m not going to fall for it this time.)
If you still want it, of course.
I do, but-
Should I just leave it over here?
(She bends over seductively, as she places the book on your nightstand.)
(Damn, she’s got such a sexy little ass...)
(Wait! No...what am I thinking?!)
(I need to tell her to leave.)
Listen, Olivia-
(She ignores you and gets in bed.)
Can you scoot over a bit?
Oh...right.
(Why am I not telling her to go?)
(I can still send her away...)
Thanks for letting me stay, [NAME_1].
I feel so much better knowing you’re here to protect me.
(That poor girl is clearly scared.)
(…)
(I’m just helping her feel safe.)
(…)
(There's nothing wrong with that, is there?)
(…)
Good night, [NAME_1].
Good night…
(...)
The next morning…
*Zzz*
*Yawn*
(What the hell?!)
(Olivia is wrapped around you, hugging you tightly.)
(You can feel her warmth against your body.)
(And to make matters worse…)
(You have a bad case of morning wood.)
(Crap! I need to get up before Olivia-)
Good morning.
Oh! Good morning...
(Great! What do I do now?)
I can't remember the last time I slept this well.
That's...good.
It is. Thanks for letting me stay, [NAME_1].
(Fuck! I need to get up before she notices.)
I really appreciate-
Anyway, I better get ready for work.
(You gently push her off and sit up.)
Hey...what's with the rush?
I was hoping we could stay in bed a bit longer...
I don't think that's a good idea.
Aww...why not?!
(Because I'm turned on enough as it is already.)
Because it wouldn't be very...appropriate.
Don't start with that again...
There's nothing wrong with a bit of cuddling, is there?
Sorry, but I really need to get ready for work.
Fine! But you're not leaving without a hug.
There's no need for-
(She suddenly gets up and wraps her arms around you.)
*Giggles* Got you!
Did you really think I-
*Gasp*
I..uhm...I'm gonna take a shower.
(As you pull away Olivia's arm, her hand brushes against your dick.)
(You quickly get up, feeling very flustered.)
*Giggles* Better make it a cold one...
Right.
(You awkwardly walk out of the room, holding your clothes while trying to cover your boner.)
Mmm...
A few minutes later...
(Damn! She's really messing with my head...)
(It seems like she's used to getting her way.)
(And I'm not sure I buy the whole innocent act either...)
(Was she really afraid last night...)
(Or did she have an ulterior motive?)
(Frankly, I wouldn't be surprised if she was the one blackmailing me all along.)
(I should be careful about letting my guard down around her.)
(But I can't deny that she turns me on.)
(It felt so good having her tight, little body pressed against me.)
(I wouldn't be opposed to sharing my bed with her again...)
(But I should be careful.)
(I'm playing with fire here.)
(Whatever I do, I can't get caught.)
A few minutes later...
(I guess she already left.)
(She even made the bed up...)
(That's sweet of her.)
(Oh, the book!)
(I almost forgot about that.)
(You walk over to your nightstand.)
(Now I can finally solve the mystery of the bookshelf!)
(I think it's time to pay a visit to the study.)
Later that night...
*Zzz*
(You wake up to the sound of your bedroom door opening.)
Olivia...is that you?
Oh, good...you're awake.
(I am now.)
(She enters your room and walks up to your bed.)
Well?
Well...what?
Aren't you going to scoot over?
(Not this again.)
You can't stay here, Olivia.
Why not?!
I gave you the book, right?
Just like I promised...
I know...and I let you stay that night.
But that was a one-time thing.
What?! That's not fair!
You should have said that!
Well, I assumed it was-
So you just tricked me into giving you the book?!
No! That's not what-
I can't believe you used me like that!
I'm going to tell [REL_M2]!
(She storms off.)
(Oh, shit!)
(I have to stop her!)
Olivia, wait!
I...didn't mean it like that.
You're right, I should have made it more clear...
Yes, you should have...
Look, I'm sorry. Okay?
Does that mean I can stay?
*Sigh* (I really don't feel like dealing with this right now.)
Fine.
(Her bad mood seems to disappear instantly, as she gets in bed with you.)
Thanks, [NAME_1]!
Good night!
Yeah, good night...
(As she lies down next to you, you can't help but wonder...)
(Would she really have told Madeline about this?)
(Knowing it would have gotten me fired...)
(Or was she just bluffing?)
(Whatever, I'm too tired to think about it.)
(Let's just go to sleep.)
The next morning…
*Zzz*
*Yawn*
(Just like before, Olivia is hugging you tightly.)
(And just like before...)
(You have a rock-hard erection.)
(Of course...)
Good morning, [NAME_1].
Good morning.
(Fuck it! I'll just get out of bed quickly-)
(Suddenly, there is a knock at the door.)
[NAME_1]? Is there someone in there with you?
(Crap! It's Rebecca!)
N-No! It's just me!
I'm sure I heard voices...I'm coming in!
(Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!)
*Whisper* Quick! Hide!
(You panic and push Olivia under the blankets...)
*Gasp*
*Softly* Mmm...
(...just as Rebecca opens the door.)
What the hell, Rebecca?!
You can't just barge in here like this!
*Scoffs* I heard you talking to someone.
And I'm sure I don't have to explain to you that Miss Caine does not allow you to have guests over.
Well, you heard wrong!
As you can clearly see, it's just me in here.
(Fuck..)
(I can feel Olivia's breath against my dick.)
(And it's only making me harder.)
Yes...it appears so.
I must have misheard.
...
My apologies.
Whatever. It's fine.
Now, if you don't mind please-
*Sniff*
(What the hell?!)
(Is Olivia...)
*Sniff*
(Smelling my dick?!)
*Sniff*
*Soft* Mmm...
Is something the matter?
N-No, I just...need some time to wake up.
So, if you'll excuse me now?
Oh, yes...of course.
(She finally leaves and closes the door.)
(You wait a few seconds, to make sure she's gone...)
(Before you pull away the blankets.)
*Whisper* Olivia! What the hell are you doing?!
*Giggles* Smelling-
*Whisper* Shhh! Keep your voice down!
*Whisper* Oh, sorry...
*Whisper* Smelling your penis.
(Okay...as if that isn't weird at all.)
*Whisper* I like it.
What?!
*Whisper* It smells nice.
(Is she turning me on on purpose?!)
(Or does she just not realize what she's saying?)
*Whisper* Uhm...well, can you stop doing that and get off me?
*Whisper* Oh...sure.
A bit later...
*Whisper* That was way too close.
*Whisper* Look, you can't sleep here anymore, Olivia.
*Whisper* If Rebecca would have caught you in here, [REL_M4] would fire me in a hearbeat!
*Whisper* And then we won't be able to spend anymore time together at all!
*Whisper* You don't want that to happen, do you?
*Whisper* No! Of course not!
*Whisper* Well, neither do I.
*Whisper* But that means you can't do anything that would get me in trouble with [REL_M4].
*Whisper* Okay?
*Whisper* I'm sorry, [NAME_1]...
*Whisper* I won't.
*Whisper* Good.
*Whisper* Now, you better get out of here before someone sees you.
*Whisper* Okay. See you later, [NAME_1].
(She carefully sneaks out your room, making sure no one sees her.)
*Sigh*
(I hope I wasn't too harsh on her.)
(Let's just hope she gets the message this time.)
(Now, let's get dressed.)
The next morning...
*Yawn*
(I wonder what today has in store for-)
(What the fuck?!)
(When did she get in bed with me?!)
(And of course, I have morning wood again...)
*Giggles* Good morning, babe!
(Babe?)
Olivia! You can't just sneak into my bed whenever-
*Knock* [NAME_1]?
(Give me a break!)
I'm not dressed!
Don't-
I'm coming in!
(For fuck's sake!)
*Whisper* Hurry!
(You push Olivia under the blankets again...)
(...just before Rebecca opens the door.)
*Softly* Hmm...
(Damn it! Why does this keep happening?!)
Can you stop doing that?!
You can't keep barging in here whenever you please!
*Scoffs* I heard someone laughing...
This time, I'm certain!
Well, maybe you should get your ears checked.
Because as you can see, it's still just me in here.
*Sniff*
(Not this again?!)
*Sniff*
(Why is she so obsessed with the smell of my dick?)
(And what is she doing now?!)
(She wraps her hand around your shaft...)
(And squeezes it...hard.)
(A drop of pre-cum leaks out.)
I don't know what you are up to...
But I assure you...sooner or later, I will find out!
I'm not up to anything!
You're just being paranoid.
Why would I-
<bounce><b>(W-What the fuck?!)<b></bounce>
*Soft moan* Hmm...
(Is she crazy?!)
Why would you...what?
R-Right...why would I?
...
I'm keeping my eye on you...
(She closes the door.)
(You angrily pull away the blankets.)
*Whisper* What the fuck, Olivia?!
*Whisper* I know, right?
*Whisper* She is <i>so</i> uptight.
(Huh?)
*Whisper* I'm not talking about Rebecca!
*Whisper* What the hell do <i>you</i> think you're doing?!
*Whisper* Me?
*Whisper* Oh! I was just curious how cum tasted...
(How does she make that sound like it's the most normal thing in the world?!)
*Whisper* Stacy and Lena said they liked the taste of it...
*Whisper* I just wanted to find out if I liked it as well.
*Whisper* Turns out they were right!
*Whisper* It's a bit salty...
*Giggles* But I like the taste of it!
*Whisper* Shhh! Don't let Rebecca hear you!
*Whisper* Right, sorry!
*Whisper* Anyway, thanks for letting me try it.
*Whisper* That was really sweet of you.
*Whisper* Let you?!
*Whisper* Besides...that wasn't even cum.
(Crap! I shouldn't have said that.)
*Whisper* What do you mean?
*Whisper* I saw it coming out of your...cock.
(You can't help but feel a bit turned on hearing her say that...)
(And your dick twitches involuntary.)
(She glances down.)
*Whisper* That was just...pre-cum.
*Whisper* Pre-cum?
*Whisper* You are messing with me, aren't you?
*Whisper* Of course not...
*Whisper* Wait...you don't know what pre-cum is?
(Her cheeks turn red.)
*Whisper* N-No...
(How does she not know about this?!)
*Whisper* Whatever, it doesn't matter...you have to leave before someone-
*Whisper* No! It <i>does</i> matter!
*Whisper* I hate always being the one that doesn't know about any of this...
*Whisper* That's exactly why Stacy and Lena keep making fun of me!
*Whisper* Can't you just...tell me?
*Whisper* Please?
(I'm the last person who should be talking to her about this.)
(Then again, who else could she ask?)
(And I don't want her to be made fun of again...)
*Sigh*
*Whisper* Fine.
*Whisper* It's just something that happens when a man gets...excited.
*Whisper* It both serves as a lubricant and to...clear the way...for an ejaculation.
*Whisper* Oh! So it's a bit like when I get turned on...
*Whisper* And my pussy gets wet?
(Oh, man....why does she have to say it like that?!)
Y-Yeah...something like that.
(Like before, your dick twitches in response.)
*Whisper* Huh? It just moved again...
*Whisper* Why does it keep doing that?
*Whisper* Does that mean the actual cum is coming out soon?
*Whisper* W-What?! No!
*Whisper* It's not just going to come out like that...
*Whisper* It needs to be...stimulated...more.
(I can't believe I'm teaching my [REL_S2] about sex.)
*Whisper* Stimulated?
*Whisper* Like using my hand, or mouth?
*Whisper* Uhm, yeah...I guess.
(This is so awkward.)
*Whisper* Oh, okay!
(She casually puts your dick back into her mouth.)
*Whisper* Olivia! Stop that!
*Whisper* Huh? Am I doing it wrong?
*Whisper* N-No! I mean-
*Whisper* I was just explaining it to you...
*Whisper* I didn't mean you should actually...do it.
*Whisper* Why not?
*Whisper* Look, Olivia...I keep trying to tell you...
*Whisper* We shouldn't be doing this-
*Whisper* Yeah, yeah...I know.
*Whisper* And you're right...
*Whisper* We don't want to get caught.
*Whisper* So we need to be extra careful.
*Whisper* What?! No! That's not-
*Whisper* It's fine, [NAME_1].
*Whisper* We can continue this next time.
*Whisper* Don't worry...I'll make sure no one sees me leaving.
(She gets out of bed and heads for the door.)
*Whisper* See you later, [NAME_1].
*Whisper* Thanks for...teaching me.
(She makes sure the coast is clear...)
(And then sneaks out.)
*Sigh*
(What am I going to do with her?)
(She really won't take "no" for an answer...)
(But I can't keep this up forever.)
(I can only resist so much.)
*Sigh*
(I guess it can't be helped...)
(I'm going to have to put an end to this once and for all.)
(I'll just-)
*Bzzzt*
(Huh?)
You've gotten yourself into quite a predicament, haven't you?
It looks like she wants to get you to know you on a more...intimate level.
(What the fuck?! How do they know already?!)
(Were they watching us just now?)
(Or is it Olivia after all...?)
(Either way, I shouldn't reveal I know about the hidden corridors.)
Don't worry, I was just about to put an end to it.
You will do no such thing.
In fact, the next time she tries something like that...
You are not allowed to stop her.
What?!
Oh, please.
Don't act like you don't want it.
We both know you do.
Whatever.
(Frustrated, I put away my phone.)
(As much as I hate to admit it...)
(It's true...)
(A part of me didn't want Olivia to stop.)
(But I know I shouldn't give in to those thoughts.)
(...)
(They are wrong...)
(...)
(Right?)
(Except now...I don't have a choice.)
(Do I...?)
(I have to do as that blackmailer tells me...)
(Otherwise, I'll lose my job!)
(Right?)
(It's not like I'm using that as an excuse to do what I wanted in the first place...)
(Is it?)
(Fuck! I need some time to think about this...)
(Let's just get dressed.)
(What should we talk about?)
me
you
Annabelle
Victoria
Madeline
John
Rebecca
Kate
a computer
I’m really happy you came into our lives.
It’s so cool that I have a [REL_B2] now!
And I look forward to spending more time together.
That's very sweet of you, Olivia.
So do I.
You want me to tell you about myself?!
Let's see...
Well, as you know I love swimming.
And thanks to you I get to go to practice again!
I also like watching movies.
Especially romantic or scary ones.
Ooh, and shopping!
Especially for expensive clothes.
But I guess I won't be able to do that for a while...
Anyway, that's all I can think of at the moment.
You want to talk about Annabelle?
There isn't much to tell...
She always locks herself up in her room.
I don't think she likes being around other people...
I mean, she's always nice to me when we talk...
She just doesn't want to...you know, hang out or anything.
Well, some people just prefer spending time alone.
I guess.
Like I said, she's in her room most of the time.
Yeah, but doesn't she get bored?
I mean, she must have something to keep her occupied, right?
Hmm...
I guess she's probably playing that weird game of hers.
(Weird game?)
What, you mean like a video game?
Yeah, what's it called...
Something Impact?
Uhm...
I think it was...hen die?
No, that wasn’t it...
Something like...hand tie?
Hentai?
Yes! Hentai Impact, that’s it!
Ah! I think I’ve heard of that.
(It’s an online multiplayer game, but it’s set in a Hentai world.)
(So that’s what Annabelle is doing in there all the time!)
(Hmm...)
(If I could get my hands on a computer, I could try the game myself.)
(It would give us something to talk about...)
(That might help her open up a bit.)
(At the very least, it would give me something to pass time...)
I don't know what else to tell you about her...
She's usually locks herself in her room.
So, we don't talk a lot.
(She suddenly seems guarded.)
What about her?
I was just curious-
I bet you think she’s pretty, don’t you?
Well, I-
*Scoffs* Of course you do.
Everyone thinks that…
Whatever.
I don’t want to talk about her anymore.
Oh, okay.
[REL_M2] is the best!
I really admire her.
She’s very smart and knows about a lot of stuff.
Sure, she’s a bit strict sometimes-
A bit?!
Haha! I know it might look like she’s hard on us, but that’s just because you don’t know her.
She can be a bit...over-protective...
But that’s just because she wants what’s best for us.
It sounds like she really cares for you girls.
She definitely does!
How are you holding up?
Huh?
You know, with what happened to [REL_F4] and all...
Oh! Right...
Yeah, I’m really sad.
I’m sure it's going to be very hard without him...
I can imagine.
But if there’s anything I can do for you, just let me know.
I will. Thanks, [NAME_1].
Rebecca has been with us for a long time.
She’s practically like family.
She’s very close to [REL_M2].
But she and [REL_F2] never got along...
Oh? How come?
Don't know...don't really care either.
I don’t really know her very well.
She only started working here the day before you got here.
But she seems nice.
A spare computer, you say?
Uhm...
I should have my old laptop lying around somewhere...
But it’s not nearly as fast as my new one.
That’s no problem!
I only need it to…check my mail.
Oh.
Well, I guess I could loan it to you…
Thanks, Olivia! That would be-
If you give me something in return.
Oh...
Like what?
Hmm…I’ll have to think about it for a while.
But I’ll let you know.
(Great…)
Fine.
I haven't decided what I want in return yet.
I'll let you know when I do.
Anyway, it's getting a bit late...
I should be going.
Oh, right.
Thanks for the talk, [NAME_1].
Anytime! I enjoyed talking to you.
Cool! See you later!
Later!
I should be going.
Okay, see you later!
(Hmm, apparently Olivia just got out of the bath.)
(Too bad she's holding that towel in front-)
(Oh!)
(That's more like it!)
(Wow!)
(She's got such a sexy little body...)
(You have unlocked Olivia's naked paperdoll animation.)
(I could stare at those perky tits for hours.)
(Wait! Don't leave yet!)
(You lose sight of her as she walks to the other side of the bathroom...)
(I guess the show's over...)
(Too bad.)
(In that case, I better get out of here.)
(You leave the corridor and return to the utility closet.)
(Oh! The lights are on!)
(Hmm, this seems to be some kind of...)
(BDSM room?!)
(Wait, is that...)
(Olivia?!)
-not doing my homework.
(Who is she talking to?)
Exactly.
(Madeline?)
Take off your robe.
Yes, [REL_M3].
(Olivia removes her robe...)
(Revealing a very skimpy, leather outfit underneath.)
(Why the hell is she wearing that?!)
(Don't tell me-)
Good.
Now come here.
Yes, [REL_M3].
(As Olivia moves aside, you see Madeline sitting in a chair...)
(Wearing a similar outfit.)
(No.)
(Fucking.)
(Way!)
On my lap.
Yes, [REL_M3].
(Olivia meekly obeys and bends over Madeline's lap.)
Oh?
It seems you know how to do as you're told after all, don't you?
I do, [REL_M3].
*Tsk* If only you would have listened to me in the first place...
But instead...you insist on disobeying me.
(She looks at Olivia's exposed ass.)
Leaving me with no other choice...
But to discipline you...yet again.
(A smile appears on Madeline's face.)
And you know how much I dislike having to do that...
I'm sorry, [REL_M3].
(Yeah, right.)
(She is enjoying every second of this.)
(Madeline brings up her hand...)
(And firmly smacks Olivia's ass.)
Maybe this...
*Moan* Ahh!
Will teach you...
*Moan* Ahh!
To obey me!
*Moan* Ahh!
(This is so fucked up!)
(Shouldn't I...do something?)
(Wait...)
(Could this be what Madeline meant, when she warned me not to interfere in their [REL_FM]?)
(Still...I can't just let this happen, can I?)
(It isn't...right.)
(Fuck.)
(I can feel myself getting hard.)
(What the hell is wrong with me?!)
(Why am I getting turned on by this?!)
(That poor girl is being-)
*Moan* Mmm...
(Huh? Was that-)
*Moan* Ahh...
(Is she...)
*Moan* Mmm...
(Enjoying this?!)
*Moan* Ahh...
You...
*Moan* Ahh...
Naughty...
*Moan* Ahh...
Little...
*Moan* Ahh!
Girl!
*Moan* Mmm!
*Pants* There.
(Another smile creeps onto Madeline's face.)
I hope you learned your lesson this time.
Oh yes, [REL_M3].
I certainly have.
Thank you.
(She's thanking her?!)
*Scoffs* We'll see about that.
Now, off to bed with you.
Yes, [REL_M3].
(Olivia gets back up, puts on her robe...)
(Leans in...)
(And lovingly kisses Madeline on the lips.)
Good night, [REL_M3].
Good night, honey.
(As she leaves the room, your head is filled with questions...)
(What the hell did I just witness?!)
(Seeing that they actually have a dedicated room for this...)
(I assume this is a regular thing?)
(What about the other girls? Do they come down here as well?)
(I remember Madeline telling Victoria to "see her downstairs", so that would include her as well, at the very least.)
(And what about Rebecca and Kate?)
(Do they know what's inside this room?)
(Rebecca did warn me not to snoop around in the basement.)
(And she reminded me not to interfere in any [REL_FM].)
(Come to think of it, she said this was a storage room...)
(But it sounded like she was hiding-)
(Oh, I was lost in thought so deeply that I didn't even notice Madeline leaving.)
(I guess I better go back to my room as well.)
A few minutes later...
(What a night...)
(I'm not sure what to think of all this.)
(Olivia getting punished by Madeline like that...)
(Although, it did look like they were enjoying themselves.)
(So was I, if I'm being perfectly honest.)
(Both of them wearing those sexy outfits...)
(Olivia bent over Madeline's lap like that...)
(Her sexy little ass getting redder with each slap...)
(And hearing her moan like that.)
(...)
(Maybe I should keep an eye on that room?)
(Just to make sure the girls are safe, of course.)
(Who knows what else I might see in there...)
Hey, Olivia.
[NAME_1]! You're here!
Of course! I can't keep my [REL_S2] waiting, now can I?
*Giggles* Well let's go then!
A bit later...
(You arrive at the swimming pool.)
(As you find a parking spot, you notice two girls waiting near the entrance.)
Oh! 
They’re already waiting for me. I gotta go!
All right. I’ll be here. Have fun!
Thanks! 
(She eagerly gets out of the car and runs up to the girls.)
(She seems so happy.)
(I guess she really missed going to swimming practice and hanging out with her friends.)
(Huh? Why are they looking at me like that?)
(...)
(They look surprised.)
(I guess Olivia told them about me.)
(They talk a bit longer...)
(And as they head inside, Olivia turns and waves at you.)
(You smile and wave back.)
(It’s really cute that she’s so excited about having a [REL_B2].)
(Maybe I should introduce myself to her friends next time.)
A few hours later...
(You see the two girls that Olivia was talking to earlier leaving the pool.)
(As they walk past your car, one of them whispers something to the other.)
(I wonder what Olivia told them...)
(Speak of the devil…)
(Olivia gets into the car.)
All right. Ready to go?
*Softly* I guess...
What's wrong? Didn't you have fun?
No, I didn't...
Why? What happened?
They made fun of me again.
They always do...
Who did?
Stacy and Lena.
Those girls you were talking to?
Yes...
I thought they were your friends?
They are not! They’re always picking on me!
They laughed at me and said I was lying when I told them-
(She trails off.)
Told them what?
N-Nothing…just forget about it.
Olivia, you can tell me. 
Just drop it.
 *Softly* I don’t want you to get mad at me.
(What is she talking about?)
Why would I get mad at you?
Because…I may have said something to them that was not entirely true…
Something about you...
And what was that?
You have to promise me you won’t get mad!
(It can’t be that bad.)
I won’t.
Promise!
(Sigh.)
I promise.
Well…uhm…
I…told them that you…uhm…
(Her face turns a crimson red.)
That you are my…boyfriend. 
(Great. I guess that explains the looks they were giving me...)
And why would you do that?
Because they are always making fun of me!
I’m the only girl on the team that hasn’t had a boyfriend yet!
You're still young, Olivia.
There's plenty of time for that later!
I know...
But they keep calling me stupid names…
And I hate it!
So I thought if I told them you were my boyfriend...
It would finally shut them up.
But of course, they didn't believe me and laughed at me for making it up.
(Yeah, girls that age can be pretty mean.)
Are you…mad at me?
Because you promised you wouldn’t-
I’m not mad. 
But you shouldn’t be telling lies like that, Olivia.
People might get the wrong idea.
And that could cause more trouble in the long run.
I know…
And I’m sorry.
I just...wanted the bullying to be over.
It’s okay. I get it. 
But there are other ways to deal with bullies.
I know...
Maybe I’ll just quit swimming…
Then I never have to see them again!
Don’t say that! You were so happy to go to practice again!
*Softly* Yeah, I <i>was</i>…
The only reason people bully others, is because they feel insecure about themselves.
You think so?
I know so.
They are probably just jealous of you.
Jealous? 
Of course! After all, you are…
(You playfully imitate her voice.)
Like the cutest girl ever!
(Her face lights up.)
Haha! I do <i>not</i> sound like that!
But you’re right...
I shouldn’t let them get to me.
Thanks for the pep talk, [NAME_1].
You're pretty good at this [REL_B2] thing.
(I realize that seeing her smile like that makes me happy too.) 
Hey, anything for my favorite [REL_S2]!
Now, let’s go home.
A bit later...
(You arrive back at the mansion.)
Thanks again, [NAME_1].
Next time, I won't let them get under my skin.
That's the spirit!
(She gets out of the car and goes inside.)
(You feel sorry for her.)
(First losing her father and then having to deal with those brats.)
(But it's important that she learns to stick up for herself.)
(Otherwise those girls will never leave her alone.)
(But I'll keep a close eye on those girls, just in case...)
(Anyway, let's go inside.)
Hey, Olivia.
Hey, [NAME_1]!
Ready to go?
Yep!
A bit later...
(You arrive at the swimming pool.)
(As you drive onto the parking lot, Lena and Stacy are waiting outside again.)
Oh, they’re already here…
(You can tell she’s nervous.)
Just remember what I told you.
The only reason they pick on you is because they are insecure about themselves.
Right…
Well, uhm…I’ll see you later, then?
I’ll be right here.
Okay...
(As she gets out, you can’t help feeling a bit worried for her.)
(Don't let them get to you, Olivia...)
(She walks up to the girls.)
(They seem pretty friendly...)
(Then again, they might just be acting that way, because they know I’m watching them.)
(I wonder what they are saying...)
(Maybe if I open the window a bit, I can hear them.)
-complicated.
Of course it is...
I knew you were lying right from the start!
I wasn’t lying! I just-
*Laughs* I told you, Lena…
She made it all up, just to impress us!
*Laughs* That's so sad!
That's not true! I-
He’s probably just some driver Mommy hired for her little princess.
He’s probably just some driver her mentor hired for her little princess.
I know, right? There's no way in hell a hot guy like him would go for a girl like her!
Now you're just being mean!
(Seeing them making fun of her like that pisses you off and your heart goes out to her.)
(Screw this!)
(I know I told her to just ignore them, but it’s time someone shut those brats up…)
(You get out of the car and walk up to them.)
I don't care what you two say! I-
Hey, babe. 
(Lena and Stacy look at you with surprise on their faces.)
Babe...?
No way!
[NAME_1]?!
(It takes a split second for her to realize what you are doing, but then her face lights up.)
Oh, hey…babe.
Hold up! You weren’t lying?!
He really is your boyfriend?!
*Proudly* I told you, didn’t I?
But...aren’t you like, a bit old for her?
What can I say? I guess I’m just attracted to younger girls...
Especially when they are as cute as she is.
(You wink at Olivia.)
Right, babe?
*Giggles* If you say so.
No…way….
Anyway, I'll see you later.
Have fun at practice.
Thanks, babe!
(She suddenly wraps her arms around your neck...)
(And kisses you on the lips.)
(What the hell?!)
(I guess she's really trying to sell that we're together...)
(I can hardly let her down after coming this far, can I?)
(You hide your surprise as well as you can...)
(And kiss her back.)
*Soft moan*
*Gasp*
No...fucking...way!
(Hmm, her lips are so soft...)
(As she breaks the kiss, you almost wish it would have lasted a little longer...)
(She looks deep into your eyes...)
(And she silently mouths "Thank you".)
(For a moment, you just look at each other...)
Well, let's go inside, girls.
R-Right...
S-Sure...
(And with that, you are left by yourself, feeling both conflicted and surprised.)
(That did not go exactly as planned.)
(But one thing's for sure...)
(Those girls won't be picking on her anymore.)
A few hours later...
(Stacy and Lena are leaving the pool.)
(You forgot to close your window earlier and overhear part of their conversation...)
-his dick is as big as his muscles?
Haha! Maybe we should ask Olly...
(Holy crap!)
(I don't remember girls being like this when I was young!)
(I guess times change...)
(Oh, there's Olivia.)
(She has a big smile on her face.)
Thank you <b>SO</b> much, [NAME_1]!
You are the <b>BEST</b>!
So I take it they stopped picking on you?
Yeah, they did!
And Stacy even said I'm cool!
(It's so good to see her smiling like this, even though I still wonder if I did the right thing...)
(I guess I better talk to her about it.)
About that kiss-
Oh my God! That was perfect!
Did you see the look on their faces?!
(You can't help but get caught up in her energy.)
(She's so happy right now...)
(I don't want to ruin this moment.)
(Besides, it was just an innocent kiss...)
(There's no need to make a big deal out of it.)
I sure did! We got them good, didn't we?
We totally did!
A bit later...
(You arrive back at the mansion.)
Thanks again, [NAME_1].
You really are the best!
Don't mention it.
(Especially not to Madeline...)
(She gets out of the car and goes inside.)
(I'm glad she's feeling better.)
(I just hope I'm not getting myself into more trouble...)
(You go back inside.)
Hey, Olivia.
Hey, [NAME_1]!
All set?
Yeah, let's go!
A bit later...
(You arrive at the swimming pool.)
(As usual, Lena and Stacy are waiting outside.)
So...uhm, would you mind...
Coming out and saying hi to them?
(I guess she just wants to show me off a bit.)
(That's kind of cute.)
Sure, let's go.
(She looks relieved.)
Cool, thanks!
(The two of you get out of the car and walk up to the girls.)
Hey, you guys.
Hey.
Hi, [NAME_1].
(She smiles seductively at you.)
Hey, girls.
So, what's up?
Oh! We were just talking about the couples contest.
(Couples contest?)
Oh...
(Olivia shoots you a nervous glance.)
Did you sign up yet?
Uhm…well, I’m not sure if I'm going to-
Oh, come on!
You don’t have an excuse this time, Olivia…
After all, you have a partner now, right?
I know…but, uhm-
Don’t tell me you’re chickening out again?!
It's not like that! It's just-
(She gives you another nervous look.)
(So that's how it is?)
(Well, fuck it!)
(I’m not going to give them another reason to pick on Olivia.)
Of course, we’re signing up.
Didn’t you say you were going to do that today, babe?
Huh?
Oh! Right!
Yeah, as a matter of fact, I did.
I was gonna do it after practice.
(Stacy and Lena exchange surprised glances.)
You are?!
Of course!
That's awesome!
But you guys better be prepared to lose!
Because I’m sorry, [NAME_1]…
But you’re no match for my Trevor.
Yeah, right!
This year, Danny and I will win for sure!
Haha! In your dreams!
(I have no idea what exactly I just agreed to…)
(But I’m sure as hell not planning on letting these brats win.)
Oh! We better go inside, or we’ll be late.
Right.
(Olivia wraps her arms around your neck again…)
(And kisses you.)
*Soft moan* Mmm…
(Her lips linger a little longer this time.)
(Well, in for a penny...)
(She slips in a bit of tongue.)
(Cheeky girl.)
*Softly* Thanks.
See you later, babe!
Yeah, see you later…
(She smiles warmly and they head inside.)
A few hours later...
(There's Olivia.)
(She looks happy.)
Oh my God! You are the <b>BEST</b>, [NAME_1]!
I can't believe we're actually doing the couples contest!
So, what kind of contest is it exactly?
It's different each year.
But basically they come up with some silly pool games...
And the couple that has the highest score at the end of the day, wins.
And with you as my partner, I think that might be us!
Ooh...can you imagine the look on Stacy's face if we beat her and Trevor?
Now <i>that</i> is something I'd like to see!
I know, right?!
I better start practicing then...
I don't want to let you down.
Trust me, you'll be fine.
You are in <i>much</i> better shape than all the other partners.
The girls will be <i>so</i> jealous when they see how fit you are.
Uhm...thanks?
*Giggles* Haha!
A bit later...
(You arrive back at the mansion.)
Thanks again, [NAME_1].
I can't wait for the contest!
(She gets out of the car and goes inside the mansion.)
(I just hope I can live up to her expectations.)
(I'd hate to disappoint her...)
(Or give those girls the satisfaction of winning, for that matter.)
(I guess we'll find out soon enough...)
(You go back inside.)
Hey, Olivia.
Hey, [NAME_1]!
Ready to go?
Yep!
A few hours later...
(You arrive back at the mansion.)
Thanks for the ride, [NAME_1].
No problem!
(She gets out of the car and goes inside the mansion.)
(Hmm, that was a bit...uneventful.)
(Oh, well.)
(You follow her inside.)
Hey, Olivia.
Hey, [NAME_1]!
Are you ready for the big day?
(Go to the swimming contest?)
Sure am!
Not yet.
Great! Let's go then!
Half an hour later...
Wow! It's a lot more crowded than usual.
Yeah, they're all here for the contest.
Let’s go inside and get ready.
All right.
A few minutes later...
You can get changed here.
I need to use the bathroom really quick.
I'll meet you at the lockers in the back when I'm ready, okay?
Sure.
(She heads down the corridor.)
(Let's go get changed.)
A bit later...
(All right, I guess I'll just wait for Olivia to get ready.)
(As you leave the stall, you overhear someone talking.)
*Whisper* Come on, babe...
*Whisper* Can't we at least try to win?
(You move a little closer.)
*Whisper* No, Trevor!
*Whisper* We've been over this already!
(It's coming from this stall...)
*Whisper* But you know how much I hate losing!
*Whisper* Besides...people expect us to win, we-
*Sigh*
*Whisper* Look, I promised her, okay?
*Whisper* And I'm not gonna break my promise over some lame contest.
*Whisper* Now quit whining and let's go.
(The stall door opens.)
*Gasp*
Oh...hey, [NAME_1].
Hello, Stacy.
(Is she checking me out?)
(In that case...)
(...I guess I might as well return the favor.)
(Damn! She's got such a sexy, little body...)
Huh?
Oh! What’s up, dude?
Hey.
So...ready for the big competition?
As ready as I’ll ever be...
Cool.
See you out there then.
Later, dude.
Yeah, later.
(They head for the pool.)
(Hmm, she's got a nice ass...)
That the guy?
*Whisper* Keep your voice down!
*Whisper* Sorry...
*Whisper* That the guy?
*Sigh* Yes...
(They disappear around the corner.)
(Hmm...what was that all about?)
(Whatever. I guess I'll just go and wait for Olivia.)
Ten minutes later...
(What's taking her so long?)
(We're going to be late-)
(Oh, there she is.)
Ready!
Okay, let's go then.
Meanwhile...
Looks like you got off easy this year, Trevor.
Trust me, buddy.
I could beat you with my eyes closed.
You're just lucky that the girls agreed to-
Quiet. They're here...
(As soon as you enter the pool area...)
(All eyes are on you.)
Hi, guys!
Hey!
So, you must be [NAME_1].
I hope you're ready for-
Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls...
Welcome to the Annual Aquatics Center Couples Competition!
This year, we've got three new and exciting challenges planned for our couples!
So, contestants...
Please make your way to the pool for the first round.
A few minutes later...
We will begin the competition with a timed race.
The girls will swim one lap as fast they can...
Followed by the boys.
The combined time for both laps will determine each couple's score.
All right! Let's do this, [NAME_1]!
Yeah, good luck!
Ladies, please get ready...
A bit later...
Get set...
Go!
And they're off...
Lena immediately takes the lead!
But Stacy is right behind her...
Followed closely by Olivia and Ellen!
Stacy has caught up with Lena!
Sabrina is lagging behind...come on, Sabrina!
Stacy passes Lena and has taken the lead!
But Lena and Olivia are right behind her!
Stacy is the first to reach the end and is turning back!
(Come on, Olivia!)
But it's still anyone's game...*Softly* Except Sabrina's...
Olivia has passed Lena and is now closing in on Stacy!
(Yes!)
This is going to be a tight finish, folks!
Olivia has caught up with Stacy and they are neck and neck now!
(You can do it Olivia!)
And....Olivia finishes in first place just before Stacy!
(Yessss!)
Followed closely by Lena and then Ellen! *Softly* And finally Sabrina...
What an exciting race, folks!
Next, it's up to the boys!
A bit later...
Get set...
Go!
And they're off!
Danny and Trevor take the lead!
Newcomer [NAME_1] is close behind them, followed by Dane and Steve.
(Damn! Those guys are fast!)
Trevor is a slightly ahead of Danny...
[NAME_1] is trying to close the gap.
Danny has caught up with Trevor again!
This is like last year all over again!
Will Danny finally be able to beat the reigning champion, Trevor, this time?
(What the fuck...reigning champion?!)
Danny and Trevor have increased their lead even further...
It looks like it's going to be another close-
Oh?! It seems I spoke too soon...
(Huh...why are they slowing down?)
It seems their fatigue has kicked in...
And now newcomer [NAME_1] has caught up with them!
And right before the finish, he manages to snatch away the win from both of them!
(I...won?!)
And now Dane and Steve finish as well. Great job guys!
What an exhilarating race!
A bit later...
Wow! That was amazing, [NAME_1]!
I didn't know you were such a good swimmer.
Neither did I...
(I'm pretty sure those two let me win.)
(So, that's what Stacy and Trevor were talking about earlier?)
(Hmm...why would they want me to win?)
All right, couples...get ready for the next part of the competition!
Girls, please get back into the pool.
A bit later...
For our second challenge, the girls will pretend to be drowning...
The boys will have to rescue them before it's too late!
So boys, rush over to your girl...
And get her to safety as fast as you can.
(That sounds easy enough...)
Get ready in...
Three...
Two...
One...
Go!
(You quickly jump in and swim towards Olivia as fast as you can.)
And it looks like [NAME_1] is the first one to close the distance!
Are they going to win this challenge as well?!
All right, let's get you out of the water.
(You carry her out with ease.)
And they are already out of the water...
But Trevor And Stacy are close behind!
(You gently lay her down...)
(Lean over her...)
(And soflty kiss her lips.)
But wait...what is this?!
[NAME_1] failed to resuscitate Olivia!
It seems you will have to try harder, [NAME_1]!
(Are you kidding me?!)
Trevor is the first to bring his girl back to life!
And now Danny and Lena are out of the pool as well!
What are you doing, Olivia?!
We lost our lead!
*Whisper* We'll get bonus points for the most passionate kiss...
*Whisper* You have to do better than that!
And Danny and Lena finish in second place!
*Sigh* Damn it!
(You lean over her again.)
It looks like [NAME_1] is going for another attempt!
(You kiss Olivia again...)
(Making sure to let your lips linger on hers a bit longer this time...)
(She parts her lips and slips her tongue inside of your mouth.)
*Soft moan* Mmm...
WoW! Now <i>that's</i> what I call mouth-to-mouth, folks!
(A smile appears on Olivia's face.)
*Giggles* I'm alive!
And now Olivia wakes up too, putting them in third place!
Followed closely by Ellen-
...
......
.........
And finally Sabrina as well...
Yay! We got third place!
Well done, [NAME_1]!
We can still win this!
We just have to make sure we finish first in the final challenge.
*Sigh* Right...
A bit later...
And now for the final challenge...
The boys will tread water for as long as they can...
(Oh! That sounds easy enough-)
...while the girls hang onto them!
(Of course...)
If you let go, or your boyfriend's head goes under water...you are both out!
So girls, get back into the water and hug your boyfriends like you mean it!
(Olivia immediately jumps in...)
(And wraps herself around you without hesitation.)
Get ready in...
Three...
Two...
One...
And we're off!
(You suddenly find yourself in a rather intimate position...)
(Olivia's face is very close to yours...)
(And she's staring at you with those big, beautiful, green eyes.)
(And to make things worse....)
(She has her legs wrapped around your waist tightly...)
(Causing her crotch to grind against yours with every move you make.)
(Why did she have position herself like that?!)
(Crap! I'm getting turned on!)
(You feel your dick growing hard...)
(And it's now pressing directly against her pussy.)
(Fuck!)
(This is bad!)
(Should I push her off?)
(But if do...)
(We will lose for sure.)
(Maybe she won't notice?)
(You nervously look at her face, waiting to see her reaction.)
*Gasp* Huh?!
(Who am I kidding?)
(The tip of my dick is practically inside of her...)
(Of course she's going to notice that!)
(Fuck! What should I do?)
(Her cheeks turn red and she bites her lip.)
(She looks up at you..)
S-Sorry about that!
I-I couldn't help it!
Maybe it's better if we-
It's fine...
Just...keep going...
But-
I really want to win this, [NAME_1]...
So please...just...
Keep going...
...for as long as you can.
(I don't want us to lose because of me...)
(I can't let her down.)
Okay...
(I have to admit that part of me really enjoys the sensation...)
(...of her pussy pressing against my throbbing dick.)
(Besides, it looks likes Olivia doesn't mind all that much either...)
*Soft moan* Mmm...
(Wait! Did she just-?)
And there goes our first couple.
Too bad, Sabrina and Steve!
Ladies, don't forget to encourage your boyfriends...
They are doing all the hard work here!
*Pant* Don't...give up, [NAME_1].
*Pant* You're doing...great!
*Soft moan* Just...mmm-
*Pant* A little longer.
And there goes another couple.
Sorry guys, better luck next year.
Just three couples left.
Hang in there boys!
*Pant* You are doing...so good...
*Soft moan* Don't stop! I-I'm almost there!
(Wait, what?!)
And both Trevor and Danny seem to have reached their limit as well!
Congratulations to Olivia and [NAME_1]!
Hello, guys? You can stop now! You've won!
*Soft moan* N-Not yet!
Al...most...
(Suddenly Olivia throws her head back.)
*Moan* Ahh...yes!
Are they trying to set a new record or something?!
*Moan* YES!!!
Wow! Olivia is absolutely ecstatic!
It looks like she REALLY wanted to win!
*Pant* Thanks, [NAME_1]...
*Pant* You were...
*Pant* Amazing!
(She leans in and kisses you passionately.)
*Soft moan* Mmm...
Ah! To be young and in love!
Isn't it beautiful?
*Soft moan* Mmm...
*Clears throat* Ahem.
And that concludes our final challenge...
So, couples, come on out and get ready for the results!
A bit later...
Congratulations to the winning couple, Olivia and [NAME_1]!
You are the proud winners of this year's prize...
Generously sponsored by Lena's parents, Mr. and Mrs. Dunham...
An all-inclusive couples day at the Dunham's Spa!
And that concludes this year's season!
See you all next year!
Wow! A spa day?! That sounds awesome!
I can't believe we won, [NAME_1]!
Congrats, you guys!
Yeah, good job!
...
*Grunt*
Oh, yeah...congrats.
I guess I'll see you guys at our spa then?
Oh...I don't know-
Of course they'll come!
It's like the ultimate, romantic date!
Any couple would love that!
Right, [NAME_1]?
(Olivia looks up at you with pleading eyes.)
(Crap! Stacy's really putting me on the spot here.)
(And I don't want to embarrass Olivia...)
Yeah, sure.
Cool!
Oh! The next group is already coming in, so it's going to be really crowded in a minute...
We better go and get changed.
Back at the changing booths...
(Lena was right...)
(Most of the booths are already taken.)
Over here, [NAME_1]...
I saved you a booth.
Oh, thanks!
But you guys better get in before someone else takes it!
(Oh, crap!)
(She expects us to share it?!)
(It would be suspicious if I refuse now...)
(So I guess I don't really have much of a choice.)
(You both enter the cramped fitting booth.)
So, uhm...
*Whisper* I guess I'll just...turn around.
*Whisper* Oh...right.
(You awkwardly face away from each other...)
(And start undressing.)
Thanks for trying so hard today, [NAME_1].
I'm so happy we won!
Oh, yeah...no problem.
(You can't help yourself and glance over your shoulder...)
(Oh, man!)
I'm just happy that you're happy.
Aww, [NAME_1]...
That's so sweet!
(She suddenly hugs you tightly from behind, pressing her naked body against you.)
(What the hell?!)
You are the best boyfriend ever!
(You can feel her perky breasts against your back.)
*Whisper* Uhm...Olivia?
*Whisper* I'm still...naked.
*Giggles* Oh! Whoops, haha!
*Whisper* Well, it's not like I've never seen you naked before, right?
(She holds you even more tightly, moving her hand dangerously close to your dick.)
(Fuck! I'm getting hard again...)
*Whisper* Look, Olivia...
*Whisper* I think you're taking this whole boyfriend thing a little too far.
*Whisper* This is getting very...inappropriate.
*Whisper* Inappropriate?
*Whisper* I just like hugging my sexy boyfriend...what's wrong with that?!
(Oh man, this girl is driving me crazy.)
*Whisper* Well, for starters, we're not wearing any clothes...
*Whisper* And more importantly...I'm not your "sexy boyfriend", Olivia...I'm your [REL_B1]!
*Whisper* So?
*Whisper* Just because you're my [REL_B1], doesn't mean I can't be attracted to you.
*Whisper* Actually, yes! That's exactly what it means!
What do you mean?
(She suddenly grabs your dick and squeezes it gently.)
(W-What the fuck?!)
*Whisper* See? It's getting hard...again!
*Whisper* Why does that keep happening when we are together?
*Whisper* Don't tell me you are getting turned on by your [REL_S2]...
*Giggles* Now <i>that</i> wouldn't be very...appropriate, would it?
(You grab her wrist.)
What the hell, Olivia?!
(You turn around to confront her...)
I'm being serious! You can't just-
(...but it completely slips your mind that she is still naked as well.)
(Without thinking, you stare at her beautiful body.)
(Fuck! She is so sexy...)
(She looks down at your, now rock-hard, erection and laughs triumphantly.)
*Giggles* You were saying?
I, uhm...
(For some reason, you completely forgot...)
*Whisper* Don't worry, [NAME_1]...
*Whisper* I won't tell [REL_M2].
*Whisper* It will be our little secret...
(You just look at her, dumbfounded.)
*Giggles* Now if you're done gawking...
We better get dressed.
(You feel your cheeks flush.)
Oh...r-right.
(Wait...what the hell just happened?)
(Didn't I-)
(I mean, she was-)
*Sigh*
(Whatever...let's just get dressed.)
After an uncomfortable car ride back home...
(You arrive back at the mansion.)
Thanks again, [NAME_1].
This was the best day ever!
(She gets out of the car without waiting for your response and goes inside.)
(Well...that didn't entirely go as I expected...)
(But at least we won.)
(Although...it did seem like Trevor and Danny intentionally held back...)
(But why would they do that?)
(I think I'm missing something...)
(...)
(Oh well, at least Olivia probably won't be bullied by Stacy and Lena anymore.)
(So I guess it's not all bad.)
(But I'm definitely going to have to keep an eye on her...)
(It's clear that her interest in me is starting to become a bit...problematic.)
(I can't let that escalate any further.)
(...)
(Can I?)
(...)
(Wait, am I really worried about her behavior?)
(Or am I just worried about being caught by Madeline?)
(I can't deny that I'm attracted to her-)
(No! What am I thinking?!)
(She's still my [REL_S2]...)
(Ugh. My head hurts.)
(I don't want to think about it right now...)
(Let's just go inside.)
I think I need some more practice.
Oh, well you better get to it then...
The contest is right around the corner!
Yeah, I will.
Meanwhile...
(What's taking [NAME_1] so long?)
(I'm never going to make swimming practice in time!)
<bounce><b>[REL_M2]!</bounce></b>
She has been in the employ of the [REL_FAM] for many years, and seems to genuinely care for Madeline and the girls.

cleaning
?
?
I'm sure something will happen eventually. I just need to be patient.
I'm sure she'll come find me if she wants to talk to me.
I'm keeping my eye on him. I'm not going to let him hurt the girls.
I don't know if he can be trusted. I'm not letting my guard down around him.
-u
(I should get ready for bed. I have another early day tomorrow.)
A few minutes later...
(All done.)
(Someone is knocking at your bedroom door.)
(Huh?)
Come in.
Do you have a moment, [NAME_1]?
(Not her again.)
It’s late. Can’t it wait until tomorrow?
Actually, I was hoping we could talk…
(Screw that. I’m done being nice to her.)
Well, I’m tired and I need to go to bed.
I see…
(You hear the door close.)
(Maybe that was a bit harsh?)
(No. She deserves it after the way she treated me.)
(Maybe that will teach-)
*Zip*
(Huh?!)
I think we started off on the wrong foot.
(What the hell?!)
Didn’t I just tell you to-
...leave.
(Wow! I did <i>not</i> expect that...)
Come on, [NAME_1]. There has to be <i>something</i> I can do to make it up to you…
(Your eyes are drawn to her neatly trimmed bush.)
(Mmm...)
(Your anger quickly fades away and is replaced by lust.)
(And you feel your dick starting to throb in anticipation.)
(But you know you shouldn't be doing this.)
I'm not sure this is a good idea, Rebecca.
(Though it pains me to say it.)
Aw...
Don't say that.
(She steps closer.)
I’m sure we can be friends.
(She puts her hand on your crotch.)
Maybe we just need to try a bit…
(And teasingly squeezes your balls.)
Harder.
Don’t you want us to be friends, [NAME_1]?
I do, but-
Great! We’re already getting along so much better.
(She slowly traces her fingers up, along the length of your shaft.)
And friends help each other, don’t they?
(Fuck! I know I shouldn't be doing this, but I'm so horny right now...)
Of course.
(She squats down in front of you.)
*Soft moan* Ah…
Then let me help you with this.
As a token of our friendship?
(Fuck it! It's been way too long since I had some action.)
(Let alone with a gorgeous girl like her.)
(Besides, she's practically begging for it!)
All right then.
See? I knew we would become friends...
(I don’t really understand what’s gotten into her...)
(But I like this side of her a <b>lot</b> better.)
(She slides her wet, warm lips over the tip of your dick.)
Mmm...
(And starts sucking you off.)
(She stops.)
*Moan* Mmm...
I'm afraid this won't do...
Huh?
(She gets up and walks over to the bed.)
Sucking your big cock has gotten me all wet, [NAME_1].
So I need you to come over here...
(Oh, damn!)
And let me feel you inside of me.
(And I thought <b>yesterday</b> was my lucky day!)
(She bends over and leans on the bed enticingly.)
Well? What are you waiting for?
Heh. Aren't you an impatient little thing?
Oh, I am.
Now come over here and fuck me.
Gladly.
(You get behind her.)
(And firmly grab her waist.)
*Moan* Hmm, that's it.
(You slide your dick inside of her wet pussy and start fucking her.)
*Moan* Ahh...I'm gonna cum!
*Gasp* W-Wait! Not inside of me!
It's not...safe.
(Now she tells me?!)
(In that case...)
(You pull out...)
(And push her ass cheeks against your dick.)
*Moan* Ahh!
That is so-
*Moan* Ahh...hot!
(Your body tenses up as you reach your climax.)
*Moan* Ahh...
(And a wave of ecstasy washes over you...)
*Moan* Ahh!
(As you explode onto her back.)
*Moan* Mmm!
*Moan* Oh, yes!
*Pant* Wow...
*Pant* That was <b>so</b> good!
Oh, my...
You've made quite a mess.
Yeah. Sorry about that.
I guess I got a little carried away.
But that's what you get for being so damn sexy.
(You turn her around...)
(But as you pull her close, she gets a strange look in her eyes...)
(You try to kiss her, but she turns away from you.)
I...better get going.
I can't risk anyone seeing me here.
Oh. Right.
Have a good night, [NAME_1].
Yeah. You too.
(She quickly gets dressed and leaves your room.)
(Hmm, that was a little bit...abrupt.)
(But she's right. We might be putting our jobs at risk by doing this.)
(I guess I was so horny I didn't even think about that...)
(Still, it was worth it.)
(I really needed that.)
(Hopefully, she'll be back for more tomorrow. Hehe.)
(Speaking of which, I should get some sleep.)
The next morning...
*Yawn*
(Ah! I feel so relaxed.)
(Oh, I overslept a bit...)
(I guess I really needed my rest after last night. Hehe.)
(I better get dressed.)
A bit later...
(All right. What's next?)
(I could really use some caffeine right now.)
(Let's go the kitchen and get a cup of coffee.)
(You enter the kitchen and see Victoria in her workout outfit, having breakfast.)
(Rebecca is here as well, and you can't help yourself from greeting her.)
*Whisper* Good morning, gorgeous.
*Gasp*
(She nervously glances at Victoria...)
(But quickly composes herself.)
Good morning, sir.
*Whisper* What do you want?
*Whisper* Can't you see I'm busy?
(Huh? What's up with her?!)
(Maybe she's afraid Victoria will hear us?)
*Whisper* Don't worry. I just wanted-
*Whisper* I don't care what you want!
(You make a joke to lighten the mood a bit.)
*Whisper* You seemed to care last night, hehe.
*Whisper* Last night was a mistake!
(A mistake?!)
*Whisper* What do you-
*Whisper* Now, please leave me alone! I've got work to do!
(What the fuck?!)
(She seems to be back to her old, bitchy self again...)
(I wonder what made her change her mind...)
(Or maybe she just...used me for sex?)
(That's kind of hot, actually...)
(Whatever. I'm not going to follow her around like some puppy.)
(Screw that.)
You are not supposed to be in here!
Oh...sorry.
(You leave Madeline's room.)
What are you doing here?!
Get out!
Right...sorry.
(She kicked you out and locked the door.)
(Crap! Now I'll have to wait for another chance to snoop around...)
(Wait! That's a Book of Sin!)
(Should I take-)
(Suddenly, the door to the bathroom opens.)
What are you doing in Miss Caine's bedroom?!
(Oh, crap!)
(I need to come up with an excuse quickly!)
I...uh...wanted to talk to you.
To me?
About what?
(Maybe I can use this opportunity to find out why she practically ghosted me after we had sex.)
About what happened between us...
I already told you, it was a mistake!
Yes, you did.
It just doesn't make sense to me.
Did I do anything to hurt, or upset you?
(Her expression softens.)
No...you didn't.
It just wasn't...prudent of me.
I should behave like a professional.
We both should.
I see.
Well, in that case I'm sorry it happened.
I didn't mean to put you into a difficult predicament.
Oh...I-I...
*Softly* T-Thank you.
Well, I'll leave you to your duties then.
(You leave Madeline's room.)
(I still think there's something she's not telling me...)
(But at least I managed to clear the air a bit.)
(Now, how am I going to get my hands on that book?)
(I know where to find it...)
(I just need to find a moment to get into Madeline's room.)
(Maybe I can sneak in when Rebecca is cleaning the bathroom?)
(You walk up to Rebecca and greet her.)
(But the look in her eyes leaves no doubt that she is annoyed at you for distracting her from her job.)
In case you couldn't tell, I'm rather busy.
In case you couldn't tell, I'm rather busy.
In case you couldn't tell, I'm rather busy.
In case you couldn't tell, I'm rather busy.
In case you couldn't tell, I'm rather busy.
In case you couldn't tell, I'm rather busy.
There's still a lot of work to be done.
And unlike you, I don't have the luxury of just standing around doing nothing.
So if you would excuse me.
(Geez. Uptight much?)
Can't you see I'm busy, [NAME_1]?!
Please let me do my job.
Sorry.
I'm on my break.
So if you would excuse me, I'd like to have my dinner now.
Of course...
This rebellious young woman makes it very clear that she doesn't want you around. It will take a lot to break down the walls she has put up.

Boxing lessons (19:30 - 21:30)
I need to take her to her boxing lessons on Monday at 19:00.
She likes to sunbathe in the backyard in the afternoon.
She is texting in her room late in the evening, when she is supposed to be reading a certain book.
I need to take her to her boxing lessons again, on Monday at 19:00.
I could spy on her when she takes her evening bath.
I need to take her to her boxing lessons again, on Monday at 19:00.
I wonder how Madeline feels about Victoria?
She's usually on her phone at 23:00, maybe I should spy on her.
She practices her boxing in the basement in the evening.
I should give her boxing lessons, as promised.
Maybe I should give her another boxing lesson.
I should check if she really does her chores.
She likes to sunbathe in the afternoon.
Knight in shining armor
Kick Devon's ass.
There's no way that asshole is who he says he is!
Maybe he's not here just for the money...
I guess it's not that bad having him around...
Victoria! Is everything-
*Moan* Ahh-
*Gasp*
(Holy fuck!)
(She quickly pulls up the blanket...)
(...and closes her laptop.)
What the hell, [NAME_1]?!
What is your problem?!
You can’t just barge into my room like some-
(She looks down and notices you are in your boxers.)
Half-naked…uhm…
(Her voice trails off.)
I-I’m sorry!
I heard voices…
I thought you were in danger!
*Softly* Well…
(Her eyes linger on your exposed body a bit longer.)
*Softly* I’m not.
I’m really sorry, Victoria.
I will leave you to your...uhm-
I mean-
Good night.
...
Back in your room…
(I got tricked!)
(But how did the blackmailer know-)
*Bzzzt*
(Speak of the devil...)
Well done.
(Huh? They know already?!)
(That means I’m definitely being watched...)
(There’s no other explanation!)
(But by whom?)
Fuck you!
I thought she was in danger.
Come on...don't be like that.
You could show some gratitude...
Don't tell me you didn't enjoy the view?
(I did...)
(Probably more than I should have...)
(But there’s no way in hell I’m going to admit that.)
This needs to stop.
On the contrary…
We are just getting started.
 Get some sleep, Mr. Bodyguard.
I’ll be in touch.
(Damn it!)
(This is getting out of hand.)
(I need to find out who this is before I get in real trouble.)
(The only ones that could have seen me going into Victoria's room are Olivia, Annabelle and Madeline…)
(But how would they know what Victoria was doing?)
(Unless it was Victoria herself?!)
(Hmm...)
(Her reaction seemed genuine though.)
(Maybe I'm completely on the wrong track here?)
(Could it be an outsider?)
(But if so, how do they know what goes on in this house?)
(Hidden cameras?)
(Listening devices?)
(That seems a bit far-fetched...)
(But not entirely impossible either...)
(Maybe I can find some clues around the house?)
*Yawn*
(After I get some sleep...)
(Victoria is having her breakfast.)
Good morning.
Can't you see that I'm having breakfast?
Yes, but I-
Then why are you talking to me?
(I guess she's not a morning person...)
(Or a people person, for that matter.)
Oh! Hey, [NAME_1].
What's up?
(Victoria is working out.)
(She looks focused.)
(I shouldn't distract her.)
(Victoria is taking selfies of...)
(Her having lunch...?)
(The things people post on social media these days.)
(I'll just leave her to it.)
(She notices you watching her.)
Oh! Hey, [NAME_1].
What's up?
(Victoria is working on her computer.)
(I shouldn't disturb her.)
(As you walk past Victoria, she calls out to you.)
[NAME_1]! Perfect timing!
(You notice she's wearing a see-through bikini.)
(It takes all your focus not to break eye contact.)
What's up?
I'm thirsty.
Go get me a nice, cold drink.
(Who does she think I am?)
(Her personal servant?!)
(Then again, it might help me get on her good side...)
What should I do?
(Get her a drink.)
(Tell her to get it herself.)
Sure, I can get you a drink.
I'll be right back.
It's hot out here, so make it quick.
(Oh? So you like bossing people around, do you?)
A bit later...
Here you go.
(She takes the drink from you.)
*Scoffs*
I guess you are not completely useless after all.
(She returns to her chair without even so much as a "thank you".)
(Heh. She's toying with me.)
(She thinks she can get under my skin.)
(But I don't lose my cool that easily...)
(Especially not because of some spoiled little brat.)
I am your bodyguard, not your servant.
If you want a drink, get it yourself.
Oh really?
I wonder how [REL_M2] will feel about that...
About what? Her [REL_D1] acting like a spoiled brat that is too lazy to get her own drink?
(Her smug look vanishes, just for a second.)
Whatever. I'm not that thirsty anyway.
Suit yourself.
(She turns her nose up at you and goes back to sunbathing.)
(That's what I thought.)
(No. I'm done being her errand boy for today.)
(I better not push her.)
(Victoria is sunbathing.)
(I better leave her alone for now.)
(She gets up and comes over to me.)
[NAME_1]!
Just the man I need!
Hey, what's up?
Could you rub some sunscreen on my shoulders and back?
Oh...yeah sure, no problem.
Thanks!
(She sits down again, and turns her back towards me.)
The sunscreen is on the floor next to you.
Okay.
Got it.
(You squirt some sunscreen on your hands.)
Oh! One sec...
(She casually takes off her top.)
I don't want to get sunscreen all over my bikini.
Right...
There, all set.
(...)
(Why do these girls keep torturing me like this?)
(You sit down behind her...)
(And start rubbing sunscreen on her shoulders.)
(Mmm...)
(Her skin feels so smooth.)
Oh wow...
Your hands are so...
Strong.
Oh, sorry!
Am I being too rough?
Not at all...
Oh, okay.
*Softly* In fact, I prefer it a bit rough...
Sorry, what was that?
Oh, nothing...
I was just saying you are very good at this.
Oh...thanks.
A few minutes later...
There, all done.
Great. Thanks, [NAME_1].
No problem.
(Now what?)
Enjoy the sun!
Want me to do the front as well? - <b>Not implemented yet.</b>
Thanks!
I'm sure I will...
(As you get up, Victoria lies down on the deck chair.)
(Oh...she turned over.)
(That's a shame...)
(Then again, it probably would be hard to keep...professional...if she didn't.)
(Victoria is doing her homework.)
(Let's not distract her.)
(I think I better leave her alone.)
(Victoria is looking at her phone.)
(I better leave her alone.)
(Wait a minute...)
(Is that...one of the books of sin?)
(You walk up to Victoria.)
(She's wearing nothing but a top and her panties...)
(Maybe this is a bad time?)
(But I really want that book...)
(Fuck it!)
Hey, Victoria.
...
(She doesn't reply.)
*Clears throat*
...
(Is she ignoring me?!)
Victoria? I'm talk-
<bounce><b>WHAT?!</b></bounce>
Can't you see that I'm busy?!
(Again with the attitude.)
(But she doesn't just straight-up kick me out either...)
Look, I'm sorry to bother you...
But it's important.
(Well...kind of.)
That book you have there...
Can I borrow it?
What?
This old piece of garbage?
Don't tell me you're into that religious cult crap as well?
I'm not.
Then why do you want it?
I, uhm...
Let me guess...you're trying to impress [REL_M2]?
What? No...
She's really into this stuff, you know?
*Scoffs* Says it "builds character".
But there's no way in hell I'm reading this crap!
I'll take going downstairs over-
(She cuts off abruptly.)
(You remember Madeline telling Victoria to meet her downstairs, on the day of your arrival.)
What's downstairs?
Her face turns red and she averts her eyes.
*Softly* Nothing...
Really? Because-
Do you want the damn book or not?!
(Huh?)
I do.
Then take it...and just leave me alone!
(Hmm...I must have touched a nerve there.)
(But I'm not going to waste this opportunity.)
(You pick up the book.)
Thanks.
Whatever.
(Hmm...I wonder what’s downstairs?)
(Maybe I should look around a bit later?)
(Anyway, let's go. I got what I came for.)
(I already talked to her.)
(Victoria is looking at her phone.)
Hey, Victoria.
Oh! Hey, [NAME_1].
What's up?
(Victoria is talking to someone on the phone.)
Yeah, it was awesome!
Devon didn’t even stand a chance.
…
Oh, I was! 
No one has ever stood up for me like that before.
And he looked so…tough.
It was kinda hot, actually…
(Oh?)
...
Well...
I guess I changed my mind.
...
I know he is!
But that doesn’t mean I can’t find him attractive...
...
*Laughs* Shut up!
You’re so bad.
...
No, I’m never going back to that place again.
…
Actually…I was thinking about asking [NAME_1] to teach me.
…
No, boxing!
...
*Laughs* Oh my God, you’re such a slut!
(I wonder who she's talking to...)
Anyway, I’m gonna get ready for bed.
I’ll talk to you later.
...
You too, babe.
Bye!
A bit later...
(Hmm, so she wants me teach her how to fight?)
(And...she thinks I'm hot?)
(Interesting...)
(Maybe I can use this opportunity to get a bit closer to Victoria...)
(...and impress Madeline at the same time.)
(I think I have an idea...)
(Victoria is working the heavy bag.)
(Her form is way off...)
(Apparently, that punk at the gym didn't even teach her how to throw a proper jab.)
(She notices you and stops.)
Hey, [NAME_1]!
I saw you were watching...
Got any tips for me?
Oh! Yeah, I guess I can give you some pointers.
Why don't you show me that jab again?
Sure!
(She returns to the heavy bag.)
(And throws a jab.)
(Yeah, that definitely needs some improvement...)
How was that?
Not bad. But there are some things we can work on.
Really? Like what?
Show me another jab, but this time hold the position.
All right...
Like this?
Exactly.
Now, let's start with your stance...
Spread your feet out a bit more, so you are more stable.
Good.
Always keep your back foot planted firmly on the ground.
Power comes from pushing off the ball of your back foot, but you shouldn't lift it off the floor completely.
The chin is very vulnerable, so make sure to always protect it.
Tuck it down against your chest. You don't want it exposed.
There you go.
The same goes for the other side.
Keep that right hand tight against your chin.
Good.
But tuck in your right elbow as well.
Keep it close to your body, to protect your ribs.
That's it!
Now, show me another jab.
And remember to exhale this time.
Don't hold your breath when punching.
(She takes a moment to focus...)
*Exhales* Tss.
(...and throws a flawless jab.)
Perfect!
(She smiles proudly at you.)
Wow! That was awesome!
Thanks, [NAME_1]!
I didn't know there were so many things to think about...
No problem.
I know it might seem like a lot at first...
But just keep practicing and it will become second nature before you know it.
I will!
Good luck!
(As you turn to leave the basement, she stops you.)
Uhm, [NAME_1]?
One more thing...
(Here it comes...)
So, uhm...I was wondering...
Now that I won't be able to go back to the gym anymore...
Maybe you could, you know...teach me?
(You act surprised.)
Teach you, huh?
Hmm...
I guess I <i>could</i> do that...
Really?!
If you do something for me in return...
Oh...
(She suddenly gets a very seductive look in her eyes.)
Of course...
I'll do anything you want...
(You feel a stir of arousal in your pants.)
(Wait...what does she think I want her to do?!)
I...just want you to help out with some chores around the house...
O-Oh!
R-Right...
Wait a minute...did [REL_M2] put you up to this?
Not directly, no.
She did, however, mention that she thought it would be good for you to help out around the house and-
Let me guess, you are trying to get on her good side...
And you think that having a "positive influence" on me, might win her over?
(She catches on quickly...)
Basically...yeah.
I figured it might help.
Because she doesn't seem very happy with me being here so far...
Yeah...it's not easy to gain her trust...
But lucky for you, I can help with that.
(Perfect!)
How about this then...
For every hour you spend teaching me how to fight...
I'll do one hour of chores.
Deal?
Deal!
Awesome!
Just find me here whenever you have time to teach me.
And then I'll do my chores the next day, okay?
Sounds good to me.
In the mean time, keep working on that jab.
Yes, coach!
(Well, that couldn't have gone any better!)
(I can come here whenever I have some spare time to teach her...)
(And then get her to do some chores the next day.)
(I'm sure Madeline will be very appreciative of that...)
(Victoria is working the heavy bag.)
(She notices you and stops.)
Hey, [NAME_1]!
Do you have time for a lesson?
(What should I say?)
Sure, let's do it!
Sorry, not today.
Oh, okay...
I'll go get strapped up.
Awesome!
A bit later...
(You start with some basic techniques.)
Jab.
*Exhale* Tss.
Jab.
*Exhale* Tss.
Right straight.
*Exhale* Tss.
(You then move on to the heavy bag.)
One-two.
*Exhales* Tss.
*Exhales* Tss.
Good!
Jab.
*Exhales* Tss.
Jab.
*Exhales* Tss.
Three.
*Exhales* Tss.
*Exhales* Tss.
*Pants*
*Exhales* Tss.
That's it!
(She's wearing those skimpy shorts again...)
(They barely cover her tight, round ass.)
(You end with some light sparring.)
*Exhales* Tss.
*Pant*
*Exhales* Tss.
*Pant*
*Exhales* Tss.
*Pant*
*Exhales* Tss.
*Pant*
After the training...
Well done, Victoria!
Thanks, [NAME_1]!
I really enjoyed that!
You're a great coach!
I can't wait for our next lesson...
You're welcome.
Just make sure to remember your end of the bargain as well...
Yeah, yeah...
Right.
I'm going to get cleaned up.
Talk to you later!
See you later, [NAME_1]...
(You walk up to her.)
(But she seems to be lost in thought, and doesn't notice you.)
(You hear her softly humming to herself.)
(You can't resist a closer peek at those skimpy booty shorts.)
(Damn! Such a perfect ass!)
I'm happy to see you stayed true to your word.
Huh?
Oh...hey, [NAME_1].
(God, she's beautiful.)
Of course. I always keep my promises...
That's...good.
By the way...
What do you think of my shorts?
Aren't they cute?
(What's gotten into her?)
(Ever since I beat up that douchebag at the gym, she seems to be a lot more...flirty with me.)
(I better be careful...I'm on very thin ice here.)
(Besides, knowing her, she's just playing with me.)
(You resist the urge to look at her ass, and force yourself to keep eye contact.)
They look...nice.
(Still, she smiles as though she got exactly what she wanted...)
Thanks!
(...and continues her chore, humming to herself again.)
(Something tells me it's more dangerous to be on her good side...)
(Than it was to be on her bad side.)
(What should we talk about?)
me
Olivia
Annabelle
you
Madeline
John
Rebecca
Kate
I didn't know you were such a good fighter...
That's pretty cool.
It's so cool that you're teaching me how to fight!
I can't wait for our next lesson!
Olly is a sweet girl...most of the time.
But don't let those puppy eyes fool you...
She can be quite manipulative as well.
Ann's nice...
But we don't talk that much.
She's very introverted...
And spends most of her time in her room.
Oh? You want to talk about me, do you?
Why, [NAME_1]...
Don't tell me you're falling for me?
Uhm...
*Laughs* Relax! I'm just messing with you.
After all, you're still my [REL_B1]...
Right?
(She winks at you seductively.)
[REL_M2]?
We...don't get along very well.
I just get the feeling that whatever I do...
It's never good enough.
And she's much tougher on me than she is on Ann and Olly.
It's just not fair.
There's nothing to talk about.
[REL_M2] should have never married him.
All he cared about was himself...
Everyone else, he treated like crap.
So needless to say, I won't be missing him...at all.
Becca's like family.
I know she can come across a bit stern, but once you get to know her, she's really sweet.
She really looks up to [REL_M2].
Sometimes, I wonder if she's secretly got a crush on her.
But don't tell her I said that...
I don't know her very well yet...
She only just started working here.
But she's pretty.
Oh, it's getting a bit late...
I better get going.
Oh, right.
See you later, [NAME_1].
Later!
I should be going.
Oh, okay!
See you later then.
Later!
(Hmm, Victoria is taking a bath...)
(Wow!)
(She's so sexy, I could-)
(Oh! She's getting out!)
(Such a perfect body...)
(You have unlocked Victoria's naked paperdoll animation.)
(I know I shouldn't be spying on her, but-)
(She leans over the bath to take out the stopper.)
(-how can I not look at a body like that?!)
(Seriously?!)
(Look at that beautiful ass...)
*Grunts*
(Oh, man...She's killing me right now.)
*Grunts*
Got you!
(She gets back up.)
(As she moves to the other side of the bathroom, you lose sight of her.)
(Right.)
(I better get out of here...)
(You leave the corridor and return to the utility closet.)
Hey, Victoria. Are you ready to go to your boxing lesson?
*Scoffs* Took you long enough.
(I guess she’s not thrilled at the thought of me being her driver.)
Well? Are we going or what?
(Just stay calm, [NAME_1].)
Of course.
A bit later...
(An awkward silence hangs in the air.)
(There has to be something we can talk about...)
(Maybe I just need to find out what her interests are.)
So, boxing huh? That's pretty cool!
*Rolls her eyes* Let's skip the small talk, okay?
Just do your job and drive me to the gym.
Fine.
(Well, so much for breaking the ice.)
After a short drive...
(Is this really the right place?)
(It looks shady...)
Is this the right address? It doesn't look like there's a-
(She gets out without saying a word.)
...gym.
*Sigh*
(Suit yourself then.) 
(I'm basically just a glorified babysitter anyway.) 
(If Higgins really believed there was any cause for alarm, he would have never allowed me to step in.)
(Especially not considering my lack of business over the last few years.)
(He probably just wants to cover his ass, in case something does happen.)
(After all, now he can say it was Madeline's decision to hire a private security firm.)
(Oh well, I guess I shouldn't complain...)
(It's easy money. Not to mention way more than what I'm usually paid for my services.)
(So I'll just wait patiently for Victoria to finish her lesson.)
A few hours later…
*Yawn*
(Oh, I must have dozed off for a bit.)
(Several people are leaving the gym, so the lesson has probably ended.)
(You get out of the car and wait for her.)
(There she is.)
(Huh? Why is she holding her stomach like that?)
Are you okay?
Let's just…go.
You're hurt! Did something happen?
Can we go?
...
*Softly* Please?
(Something has clearly upset her.)
(Maybe it was a sparring accident?)
(But I better not push her.)
Yeah…of course.
Let me get the door for you.
*Softly* Thanks...
(On the way back you can’t help but feel a little worried.)
(Victoria has treated you like crap, but seeing her in pain doesn’t sit well with you at all.)
A bit later…
(You arrive at the mansion...)
(But before you can say anything, Victoria gets out of the car and goes inside.)
(Despite her attitude towards you, you can't help but feel sorry for her.)
(I hope she'll be all right...)
(Oh! It's getting late...)
(I better head inside as well.)
Hey, Victoria. Are you ready to go to your boxing lesson?
*Scoffs* Took you long enough.
(I guess this is going to be another long ride.)
Well? Can we go?
(The things I do for money...)
Of course.
A bit later...
(Just like last time, silence fills the air.)
(But this time, you don't even try talking to her.)
After a short drive...
(You arrive at the gym and park the car.)
(And again, she gets out without a word.)
(Well, I guess it's time for my nap...)
A few hours later…
*Yawn*
(Ah...that's better!)
(Her lesson should be over in a few minutes.)
(I guess I should at least act like this is a real job...)
(You get out of the car to wait for her.)
A few minutes later...
(There she is.)
(What the fuck?! She seems to be in pain again...)
(You get the door, without saying anything.)
...
Yo, Victoria!
(Some guy on the other side of the street calls out to her.)
See you next week!
If you got the stomach for it...
*Laughs* Haha!
(The hairs on the back of your neck stand up.)
(This guy's bad news.)
*Softly* Let's go, [NAME_1]...
On the way back home...
Who was that, Victoria?
*Softly* No one...
Is he the one who keeps hurting you?
...
Well?
Just drop it, okay?
Fine. Then I guess I'll just have to ask him myself.
His name is Devon, all right?
He's the trainer.
And he's just a typical alpha male asshole.
That's all there is to it...
You don't have to put up with this, Victoria.
You go there for boxing lessons, not to get beat up.
I...I know.
And I appreciate your concern...
But I'm fine...
*Softly* Now can we please just go home?
(It doesn't sit right with you, but you decide not to press her any further.)
A bit later…
(You arrive at the mansion...)
(Victoria gets out of the car without another word and goes inside.)
(There's something she's not telling me...)
(I know sparring can get a little rough sometimes, but this seems excessive.)
(And I have a feeling that this Devon guy is the one hurting her.)
(I think he and I should have a little chat next week...)
(You head inside.)
Ready to go?
*Scoffs* I'm surprised you made it on time.
I can see you are in your regular friendly mood.
Whatever.
Let's just go.
Fine.
(The sooner I get this over with the better.)
After yet another awkward drive...
(You arrive at the gym and park the car.)
(As usual, she gets out without a word.)
(Good riddance.)
(I might as well catch some shut-eye.)
A few hours later…
*Yawn*
(Ah...these naps are great.)
(Maybe taking Victoria to her boxing lessons isn't so bad after all.)
(Speaking of which...what's keeping her so long?)
(Most people are already coming out.)
(Should I go inside?)
(Go check on her.)
(Wait for her to return.)
Meanwhile...
Look, I already told you, Devon, I’m NOT interested!
Come on, babe, stop playing hard to get.
We both know you want to.
What part of “no” don’t you get?
I’m just here to box.
So just leave me alone and let me spar with someone else!
Now listen here, you little slut!
*Gasp* G-Get off...me!
This is MY gym!
I decide who gets to spar who!
So, you better start showing me some love...
Or you will be stuck sparring me forever.
And you know I don't hold back.
Get your hands off her…NOW!
Huh?
Relax, bro...we were just playing.
(As soon as she sees you, Victoria runs over to you.)
*Soft* Are you okay?
I'm...fine.
(You knew this guy was trouble the moment you saw him.)
(And probably the reason Victoria has been feeling miserable after each training.)
See? She’s fine!
She just needed some one-on-one coaching.
You know how these chicks are, right?
(Your hands are itching to teach this piece of shit a lesson.)
(But you know better than getting into fights that can be avoided.)
Just remember what I said, Victoria.
Next week I expect-
There won’t be a next week.
Huh? What’s that supposed to mean?
It means she won't be coming back to your sorry ass anymore.
(Suddenly Devon’s demeanor changes.)
The fuck?!
Who the hell do you think you are?!
Barging into MY gym and disrespecting ME like that?!
You better get the fuck out of here before I beat the shit out of you.
Let’s just go, [NAME_1].
(You can tell she’s scared.)
Fine.
That’s right!
You better run your little bitch-ass out of here!
And take that cock-teasing whore with you.
(Something inside of you snaps.)
(Well...)
(So much for avoiding a fight.)
No, [NAME_1]! Don’t-
Don't worry. This will only take a minute.
What? You think you’re tough?!
Big mistake, bro...
You have no idea who you're messing with.
I guess you were right...
It only did take a minute.
Now, get the FUCK out of my gym!
*Pant* R-Relax bro!
You have earned [BONUS_POINTS] <highlight>bonus points</highlight>!
*Pant* I-I was just playing!
Fuck! I...think I have a concussion.
Trust me...
If you ever come near Victoria again, I'll do much worse.
I-I won't! I promise!
J-Just...stay away from me, okay?
*Scoffs* Not so tough now, are we?
...
Let's go.
*Softly* O-Okay.
On the way back...
(Victoria keeps glancing at you.)
(What is she thinking right now?)
(As your eyes meet she averts her gaze.)
(She looks upset.)
(Is she angry with me for interfering?)
(Maybe I should have just stayed out of it...)
(She didn’t ask for my help after all.)
 I…
(Her voice trails off, her eyes drifting away from you again.)
(I'm not just going to stand by and watch that asshole put his hands on her!)
(I'm sure she understands that...right?!)
(You pull up to the mansion.)
(But unlike before, she doesn’t exit the car as soon as you stop.)
Are you…okay?
...
Are you upset with me?
With you?!
No, of course not!
Why would I be?!
Well…because of me you won’t be able to train at that gym anymore.
Trust me…I never want to go back to that place again!
Devon is an asshole! 
And he totally got what was coming to him.
Then what’s wrong?
I...
(Her voice trembles.)
I’ve been nothing but a bitch to you.
But despite all that…
You still stood up for me.
Of course I did.
You're my [REL_S1], Victoria.
We may not always see eye to eye…
But I will never let anyone hurt you.
...
Okay?
(She nods.)
Want to head inside?
(She nods again.)
(You get out of the car and walk towards her.)
(I better make sure she's all right...)
(But before you can say anything, she throws her arms around your neck, tears streaming down her cheeks.)
*Cries* I’m so sorry for how I treated you.
*Cries* You didn't deserve any of that.
*Cries* Can we just like…start over?
(You wrap your arms around her.)
I would like that.
*Cries* Me too.
(She holds onto you tightly.)
*Cries* Thank you...
*Cries* For looking out for me.
Anytime.
(She holds onto you a little longer...)
(Before letting go, almost reluctantly.)
*Sniff* I…better freshen up.
Are you sure you’re okay?
Yeah, I’ll be fine.
Thanks.
(She goes into the mansion.)
(Damn...)
(What a night.)
(At least it ended well.)
(Maybe now, we can finally put the past behind us.)
(You follow her inside.)
(Nah, she'll probably just get mad at me for not minding my own business.)
(I'm sure she'll be here anytime now.)
A few minutes later...
(Victoria gets into the car.)
(She seems to be in rough shape again.)
Are you okay?
*Softly* Just take me home.
As you wish...
(I wonder why she's always so beat up.)
(Maybe next time, I should go inside and have a look...)
Half an hour later...
(You arrive at the mansion...)
(As usual, Victoria gets out of the car as soon as you stop.)
*Sigh*
(I guess I'll go inside as well.)
Hey, Victoria. Are you ready to go to your boxing lesson?
*Scoffs* Took you long enough.
(I guess this is going to be another long ride.)
Well? Can we go?
(The things I do for money...)
Of course.
A few hours later...
(You arrive back at the mansion.)
(She gets out without saying a word.)
(Tsk. You're welcome.)
(Spoiled brat.)
(You follow her inside.)
Meanwhile...
(What the hell is keeping him so long?!)
(I'm already late for my boxing lessons!)

(You find yourself in the bustling capital of Lusteria.)
(Merchants have set up colorful stalls to display their wares, which the townsfolk are eagerly browsing.)
(Maybe someone here can tell me where I can find The Pervy Pixie.)
(Let's ask around.)
(How about that fruit vendor over there?)
Excuse me? Can you tell me-
Ah! Good day to you, sir.
Might I interest you in my wares?
I have the biggest melons in all of Lusteria!
(You don't say...)
Actually, I was wondering if you could tell me where to find The Pervy Pixie.
It should be somewhere-
Ah! Good day to you, sir.
Might I interest you in my wares?
I have the biggest melons in all of Lusteria!
(Is she trolling me?)
Yes, I heard you the first time, but I need-
You do realize you are talking to an NPC, right?
(Huh? Who said that?)
(Annabelle?!)
(What a coincidence...it's really her!)
(I can't believe my luck!)
Oh...uhm, I guess not, haha!
I take it you're new to the game?
That obvious, huh?
<b>*Smiles*</b> Sorry.
Oh, you can do emotes too?
Yeah, just type any word between asterisks.
<b>*Waves*</b> Like this?
Hee hee! There you go.
(Hmm, how do I go about this?)
(I can't just tell her I know who she is...)
(I don't want her to find out I was snooping around in her room.)
If you like, I can show you to The Pervy Pixie.
I was just going there myself.
I'll even give you some tips to get started, if you want.
That's very kind of you.
I could use some help, I'm a complete newbie when it comes to online games.
Don't worry! I'll be happy to answer any questions you have!
(She's such a sweet girl.)
(I wish I could just tell her it's me...)
(But this could work out perfectly!)
(If I drop a few subtle hints about my personal life, I'm sure she'll piece it together.)
Great! Lead the way!
Half an hour later...
And finally...The Pervy Pixie!
Oh, it's a tavern!
Yes, and it's very popular.
Many people come here to find other players to join their party.
Or simply to hang out and chat.
I see.
Well, I guess that concludes our little tour.
Feel free to leave your guide a generous tip.
(A tip?!)
Oh...I only have these five gold pieces left.
But you can have them-
<b>*Laughs*</b> Relax, I was just kidding, haha!
<b>*Sticks out tongue*</b>
(Wow! She's so...extroverted here.)
(It's like her usual shyness has completely disappeared.)
(But this might be a good chance for her to find out who I really am.)
Sorry, I guess my new job has got me a bit on edge.
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.
What kind of job is it, if you don't mind me asking?
(Jackpot!)
Well, I guess you could say I'm a bodyguard.
...
...
...
Are you still there?
Yeah, sorry. I just had to check my phone.
So uhm, what made you pick that username, by the way?
(Good! She's on to me.)
Oh...that's my real name.
Not very creative...I know.
But I just couldn't come up with anything better.
I see.
So, your name is [NAME_1]...
And you're a bodyguard?
(Come on, Annabelle...I'm sure you've figured it out by now.)
That's right.
What about you?
...
...
...
(Hmm, another long pause.)
You don't have to tell me if you-
Sorry, my phone again.
(Uh-huh.)
I'm a single mother.
So when I'm not taking care of my kids, I come here to unwind a bit.
(Huh?! Why is she lying to me?!)
(This is the perfect opportunity for her to tell me!)
(What's up with that?)
(I guess I'll just play along...for now.)
Well, thank you for showing me around.
It's been a pleasure to meet you.
You're very welcome, [NAME_1].
And the pleasure was all mine.
Now that I think about it...
I don't believe I've ever met a real bodyguard before...
(Where is she going with this?)
I bet you have some really cool stories.
Oh, trust me...it sounds more interesting than it is.
At the moment, my job basically consist of me doing nothing and staying out of everyone's way.
In fact, that's why I started playing this game.
To kill some time, you know?
Oh, really?
Why would anyone pay you to do...that?
(Hmm...what is she fishing for?)
(There has to be some reason why she's not coming clean with me.)
(Let's find out.)
Well, It's a bit of a long story.
But to summarize, I recently started working for my father's second wife, after he unexpectedly passed away.
Oh! I'm so sorry for your loss.
(It seems she's really going through with this...)
Thank you.
But that's not all...
She also has three [REL_D1+].
And to make matters more complicated....
I recently found out these girls are my [REL_S1+].
No way!
And you say your job isn't interesting?!
That sounds like something straight out of a movie!
Heh. Now that you mention it, it kinda does.
So, uhm...about these [REL_D1+]...
What about them?
What do you think of them?
(A-ha! I think I see where this is going!)
Well, of course I'm not at liberty to disclose any personal details about my clients.
And I'm only just starting to get to know them.
But they seem like nice, smart girls.
(Let's put my theory to the test.)
Very attractive.
And they each seem to have a completely different personality.
So as far as I can-
Attractive?!
Like...all three of them?
Or...what do you mean?
(And there it is.)
(Poor Annabelle.)
(If only she knew how beautiful she really is, maybe she wouldn't be so insecure.)
(Hmm, perhaps I can help her with that...)
Oh yes. All three of them.
Although one in particular is extremely beautiful.
Really? Which one?
(Her replies come a lot faster now.)
(She's clearly very interested in what I have to say.)
Well, I can't tell you her name, of course.
But, funnily enough, it is quite similar to the name you picked for your character.
...
...
...
(Another long silence.)
Are you still there?
...
...
...
(A <b>very</b> long silence...)
Uhm...hello?
I'm here!
Sorry, my daughter needed some help with her homework.
(Hmm, she's surprisingly good at lying.)
(Interesting...)
Oh! I've been playing a bit longer than I thought.
Maybe we should continue this another time?
Oh! Yeah, sure.
I can send you a friend request if you like.
That way I can see when you're online and we can send each other messages.
I mean...in case you need some help with the game or anything.
(That's perfect!)
That would be great!
Okay.
(<b>Social:</b> You have received a friend request from Bellatrix!)
(Accept?)
(Yes.)
(<b>Social:</b> Bellatrix has been added to your friends list!)
Done!
Awesome!
I guess I'll see you around then, [NAME_1]!
Yeah, see you later, Bellatrix!
(Let's see.)
(Return to world map.)
(Log off.)
(Yes.)
(Well, that went even better than I could have hoped!)
(You are met with two towering wooden doors, their imposing presence blocking entry into the heart of the city.)
(Thick stone walls loom high into the air, a formidable barrier against any would-be intruders.)
(People from across the kingdom have gathered here, seeking entry into the magnificent capital of Lusteria.)
(The city gates! I made it!)
(Now I just have to-)
Halt!
(Damn!)
(That's quite the guard uniform...)
Adventurers must pay a toll of 5 gold to enter the capital.
(What?!)
(That sucks!)
(I guess I have no choice but to do some quests...)
(Let's head back to the world map for now.)
(There are probably some available quests in the starting area.)
(Maybe I should check the Pristine Forest?)
(All right, let's try again.)
Halt!
Adventurers must pay a toll of 5 gold coins to enter the capital.
Pay 5 gold coins?
(Yes.)
(No.)
Very well, you may pass.
Welcome to the capital of Lusteria!
(Yes!)
(Finally!)
(<b>New location:</b> You have unlocked the capital!)
(From now on you can travel directly to the capital by selecting it on the map.)
(Let's go!)
Then stop wasting my time and get out of the way!
(You return to the world map.)
(I guess I have no choice but to pay the toll.)
(Towering trees stand sentinel, their verdant canopies reaching skyward to create a natural cathedral of green.)
(Sunlight filters through the leaves, dappling the forest floor with specks of gold.)
(The air is alive with the symphony of chirping birds and rustling leaves.)
(A cloaked figure approaches you.)
You there!
(It's an Elf huntress!)
(Known for their skill with a bow and their incredible lewdness.)
(Of course they are...)
These woods are infested with rabid squirrels.
If you slay 20 of them, I will reward you handsomely.
(Accept this quest? <b>Note: Attempting this quest will take one hour</b>.)
(Yes.)
(Not right now.)
Very well. You will find the rabid squirrels deeper into the forest.
Return to me when you have completed your task.
(She disappears into the shadows.)
(I guess it's time to go squirrel hunting.)
You journey deep inside the forest...
You find yourself surrounded by dark, ominous-looking trees. The hairs on the back of your neck stand up.
There is evil here. You can feel its eyes upon you.
(Okay, I killed 20 of those nasty critters.)
(Let's return to the huntress.)
A bit later...
I sense that the balance of the forest has been restored.
Well done, here is your reward.
(You have earned 10 gold coins.)
(You have earned [BONUS_POINTS] <highlight>bonus points</highlight>!)
(Just like before, she disappears into the shadows.)
(<b>Level up:</b> Your are now level 2!)
(Yes!)
(I should be able to enter the capital now.)
(Let's go back to the city gates.)
(Crap! I wasn't fast enough...)
(I guess I'll just have to leave and start the quest over.)
(Let's try again.)
Then you must leave these woods at once!
They are not safe!
(You do as the sexy Elf tells you.)
(I guess I'll have to complete that quest to continue.)
(Nice! Let's return to the world map.)
(Just like before, the elf huntress approaches you.)
(It seems this quest is repeatable.)
(The Elf Huntress is nowhere to be seen.)
(I guess I can only do the quest once a day.)
(Let's return to the world map.)
(I can't go to the capital yet.)
(I need to get through the city gates first.)
(I don't think Annabelle is online right now.)

(Gluttony, the vile harbinger of excess, doth poison the souls of the righteous and lead them astray from the path of temperance.)
(It is a sin born of the flesh, a covetous desire that eclipses the spirit's purity, corrupting the very essence of the divine creation.)
(O, ye faithful, beware the temptations that lay before you, for Gluttony in its relentless pursuit of gratification...)
(Damn, that sounds like something straight out of a religious cult initiation pamphlet.)
(There's no way I'm going to read that.)
(Let's just leave that where it belongs.)
*Click*
(Hmm...I wonder what happens when all slots are filled?)
(Maybe I should keep an eye out for the other books?)
(At first glance, it's just an old bookcase.)
(But there more to it than meets the eye...)
(You slide the book of <highlight>Greed</highlight> into the corresponding slot.)
(You slide the book of <highlight>Sloth</highlight> into the corresponding slot.)
(You slide the book of <highlight>Envy</highlight> into the corresponding slot.)
(You slide the book of <highlight>Pride</highlight> into the corresponding slot.)
(You slide the book of <highlight>Lust</highlight> into the corresponding slot.)
*Click*
(Good.)
(Let's look for the other books.)
(I'm getting closer...)
(Only two more books to go.)
(Almost there...)
(Just one more book to go!)
(That's the final book.)
(Huh, what is that sound?)
(Is something happen-)
(Suddenly, a hidden compartment pops open.)
(Wow!)
(That's pretty cool!)
(There is a key inside!)
(The other one seems to be missing...)
(There are also a bunch of colors in the back.)
(But I have no idea what they mean...)
(Maybe it's some kind of code?)
(The colors are...)
(<highlight>[CODE_COLOR_1]</highlight>.)
(<highlight>[CODE_COLOR_2]</highlight>.)
(<highlight>[CODE_COLOR_3]</highlight>.)
(And <highlight>[CODE_COLOR_4]</highlight>.)
(Hmm, interesting...)
(There must be some significance to these colors.)
(Anyway, I'll just take key...)
(And close the compartment for now.)
(Maybe I can find out what this key unlocks?)
(Let's have another look at those colors.)
(You press the hidden compartment and it pops open.)
(The colors are...)
(<highlight>[CODE_COLOR_1]</highlight>.)
(<highlight>[CODE_COLOR_2]</highlight>.)
(<highlight>[CODE_COLOR_3]</highlight>.)
(And <highlight>[CODE_COLOR_4]</highlight>.)
(Hmm, interesting...)
(There must be some significance to these colors.)
(Alright, let's look around the mansion to see if there are any clues to these colors.)
(You close the compartment.)

(What the hell?!)
(There's seems to be some kind of metal door here!)
(That's weird...)
(I wonder where it goes.)
(There's a numpad next to it.)
(I bet I can open that door, if I can figure out what the passcode is.)
(It's a fusebox.)
(I better not mess with it.)
(It's a big metal door.)
(Not something you would expect to see in a utility closet...)
(I'll leave the door locked for now.)
(If you want to use the hidden corridors, just click the corresponding section off the mansion map.)
(It's a big metal door.)
(It leads to the hidden corridors.)
(It's late, and I don't want to risk making any noise.)
(I should come back here during the day.)

(Yes! It worked!)
(I can't believe I managed to crack the code!)
(The metal door slides up into the ceiling.)
(No way!)
(It's some kind of hidden passage!)
(I wonder where these corridors lead.)
(I guess there's only one way to-)
(Huh?)
(Crap! Someone's coming down the stairs!)
(You quickly leave the utility closet and lock the door.)
What are you doing down here?
Oh. Hi, Rebecca.
Nothing, just...exploring the mansion a bit.
(Her eyes narrow.)
Don't bother. The door to the disc-
(She pauses.)
Storage room...is locked.
(Huh? What was she about to say?)
The storage room?
Yes, it's where Miss Caine keeps her...personal belongings and you are not to go in there under any circumstances.
(Oh, she is talking about the other door.)
Remember the terms of your contract.
You are not to interfere in any [REL_FM].
(Again with the [REL_FM]...)
(Could that be the "downstairs" they keep mentioning?)
Of course...I won't.
Good. Then I suggest you stop snooping around here.
As you wish.
...
(She is clearly waiting for you to leave.)
(You go back upstairs.)
(Hmm...I wonder what's in that "storage room" that got her so on edge?)
(Or maybe she knows about the metal door in the utility closet and doesn't want me near it?)
(Either way, I'm going to find out what's behind that door.)
(But I better wait until Rebecca finishes work.)
(I'll go back down there at 22:00.)

(You see a group of people gathered around two men who are fighting.)
(Among the crowd, you spot Ruslan and Sergei.)
(Ruslan notices you and approaches.)
Ahh, [NAME_1]!
I see you made it here after all...
Did curiousity get the better of you?
Or did you decide you could use some easy money?
Never mind...it's not important.
(An eagerness shines in his good eye.)
I take it you are here to fight?
(How should I respond?)
I am.
Not today.
Excellent!
There is only rule of this..."fight club".
Let me guess...we don't talk about it?
What? No!
How would we get new people to join if we don't talk about it?!
The rule is: always make sure your fingernails are clipped.
We don't want someone to...lose an eye.
...
...
*Crickets*
Now...
Who will you challenge?
Outstanding performance, [NAME_1]!
Here's your prize money.
(You have earned [BONUS_POINTS] <highlight>bonus points</highlight>!)
Come back any time you're up for another fight.
I expected more of you, [NAME_1]...
You might want to consider training a bit more.
Better luck next time.
Pity.
Perhaps some other time then?
Yeah, maybe.
(He walks back to his spot next to Sergei and continues watching the fight.)

(It's one of Ruslan's goons.)

Oh...it's you.
Ruslan is busy.
Come back later.
Ruslan is in his office.

(That's Ruslan...)
(If you didn't know any better, you would think he was auditioning for a role as a villian, in a low-budget James Bond movie.)
(But you do know better.)
(This is a dangerous man.)
(And you don't want to make an enemy out of him.)
(You approach him.)
Ah, if it isn't [NAME_1]!
You have some balls coming here, I'll give you that...
Especially after that little stunt you pulled with my...employee.
You're lucky I didn't send Sergei here instead...
It wouldn't have ended well for you, right Sergei?
(The big man just grins without even looking at you.)
I'm here to pay off my debt.
Are you, now?
That is...unexpected.
But welcome news, nonetheless.
I pay you the $40,000 I owe you and you stop sending your goons after me...
Agreed?
If you meant to say $50,000, we have a deal.
What?!
We agreed on 40!
No...we <b>agreed</b> that you would pay me back within 6 months.
It's been 8.
So naturally, like any other...respectable businessman, I have to charge additional interest.
(Fuck me! That's a <b>lot</b> of interest!)
(Then again, these types of deals are hardly ever fair.)
(I knew what I was getting myself into when I took his money.)
(Besides, he has a point...I didn't pay him back within the agreed time.)
*Sigh* Fine.
Here's your money.
(I guess it's back to being broke for me.)
Excellent!
It's been a pleasure doing business with you, [NAME_1].
(I wish I could say the same.)
As a matter of fact...I have another business proposal for you.
I'm not interested.
Come now, at least hear me out first.
It'll be easy money for someone like you.
I'm sure whatever it is, it isn't legal.
What?! Of course it is! 
I am an upstanding businessman, after all.
(Uh-huh.)
This is merely a small...entertainment business I run on the side.
You see, I organize fights.
The winner gets paid, simple as that.
Quite generously, I might add.
There is nothing shady about it!
(That has shady written all over it!)
Thanks for the offer, but like I said...I'm not interested.
Suit yourself.
If you ever change your mind...
Come to the Mega Mall Parking Garage any day at 22:00.
(Really? A parking garage?)
(Yeah...that doesn't sound shady at all.)
Now, if you'll excuse me, I have other matters I need to attend to.
Right.
(You leave Ruslan's office, feeling relieved to finally be debt-free.)
(Ahh! It feels like a weight has been lifted off my shoulders.)
(Too bad I don't have any cash left over...)
(But I guess I'll just wait until this job is finished.)
(It's not like I need the money right now, anyway.)
(On the other hand...)
(Ruslan mentioned the Mega Mall...)
(It might be worth checking out.)
(I could probably buy some useful things over there.)
(Anyway. What's next?)
(He doesn't even acknowledge your presence and just stares ahead blankly.)
(Yeah, it's obvious that he isn't here for his conversational skills.)
